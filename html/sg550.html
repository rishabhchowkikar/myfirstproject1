                <h2>HISTORY</h2><br>
                <h3>DEVELOPMENT</h3><br>
                <p>In 1978, the Swiss armed forces formulated requirements for a successor to the Stgw 57 battle rifle
                    (known commercially as the SG 510) using the 7.5×55mm GP 11 cartridge. Emphasis was placed on
                    modularity; the weapon family was to include several variants of the base design, including a
                    compact carbine that would be issued to rear-echelon and support troops, command staff, vehicle
                    crews, special forces personnel and paratroopers. Another aim was to reduce the overall weight of
                    the rifle while retaining comparable or improved accuracy out to 300 m. The solicitation was
                    narrowed down to two designs: the W+F C42 (developed by the state-owned Waffenfabrik Bern, using
                    both 6.45×48mm and 5.56×45mm cartridges) and the SG 541 (developed by SIG). In 1981, the
                    experimental 6.45mm GP 80 cartridge was rejected in favor of the more conventional 5.6×45mm GP 90
                    round (with a 4.1 g, tombac-jacketed, lead core projectile) that is the Swiss equivalent to NATO's
                    standard 5.56×45mm cartridge.</p><br>

                <h2>PRODUCTION</h2><br>
                <p>In February 1983, the decision to adopt the SG 541 was publicly announced (the designation of the
                    rifle was changed in October of the following year to SG 550, while the carbine version became known
                    as the SG 551). Production began in 1986 and four years later the rifle was officially accepted into
                    service in 1990, hence the military designation Stgw 90. Over 600,000 rifles have been delivered
                    since then and production for the military has now ceased.</p><br>

                <h2>DESIGN DETAILS</h2><br>
                <h3>OPERATING MECHANISM</h3><br>
                <p>The SG 550 is a selective-fire 5.56×45mm NATO assault rifle firing from a closed bolt. It has a
                    gas-actuated piston-driven long-stroke operating system derived from the SIG SG 540 series of
                    rifles, which uses burnt powder gases vented through a port in the barrel to power the weapon's
                    moving parts. Once inside the gas cylinder, propellant gases pass through an L-shaped channel
                    machined in the piston head and are directed forward towards the gas valve. The pressure build-up in
                    front of the piston head pushes the piston and bolt carrier rearward. As the piston is driven back,
                    the gas port and the L-shaped channel move out of alignment, cutting off the supply of gas to the
                    cylinder. Surplus gas and powder residues are evacuated through an exhaust port in the gas cylinder.
                    The manually adjustable gas valve has two settings, one for normal operation, and the second setting
                    for use in the presence of heavy fouling or icing.
                    The rotary bolt locking mechanism consists of two steel locking lugs that engage locking recesses in
                    the breech, and is identical to that used in the SG 540. A spring-loaded extractor is incorporated
                    into the bolt while a fixed protrusion on one of the receiver's internal guide rails ejects the
                    spent cartridge casings.

                <h3>FEATURES</h3><br>
                <p>The rifle is hammer-fired and has a trigger mechanism with an ambidextrous safety and fire selector
                    switch that has 4 settings: "S"—safe, "1"—single fire, "3"—3-round burst and "20"—fully automatic
                    fire. The 3-round burst mode "3" and the fully automatic "20" position can be disabled by a rotating
                    safety guard to avert accidentally activating the continuous fire mode. The trigger is enclosed in a
                    pivoting trigger guard which can be folded down to the left or right side allowing for unhindered
                    operation with winter gloves. The trigger pull is approximately 35 N (7.9 lbf)
                    The firearm is fed by lightweight 20-round box magazines, 30-, 10- and 5-round magazines are also
                    available. The magazines are molded from a translucent polymer and can be locked together using
                    studs in order to facilitate quicker reloading (Jungle style). The empty weight of a 20-round
                    magazine is 95 g (3.4 oz) and 110 g (3.9 oz) for a 30-round magazine.
                    A bolt hold-open device locks the bolt carrier assembly open after expending the last cartridge from
                    the magazine and is released by lifting the bolt catch lever located on the left side of the
                    receiver. Alternatively, a left-handed shooter may release the bolt by pulling the rubber-coated
                    charging handle to rear a short distance.
                    The SG 550 has a side-folding skeletonized buttstock (folds to the right side of the receiver) and a
                    lightweight aluminium bipod that folds into grooves in the lower handguard. The hinged stock is
                    firmly locked in the folded position by a socket in the butt which clips into a plastic stud on the
                    handguard; a firm pull will release the stock which is then swung into the closed position and
                    locked by a button catch. A collapsible side-folding stock is also available. The stock, pistol
                    grip, and handguards are made of a high-strength polymer, and are produced in either green or black
                    colour options. The steel receiver housing and several other components are manufactured using
                    stamping and welding; external steel surfaces are finished with a ceramic-reinforced enamel coat
                    known as Ilaflon.
                </p><br>

                <h3>SIGHTS</h3><br>
                <p>The SG 550 series rifles have a 540 mm (21.3 in) long sight radius and are equipped with iron sights
                    adjustable for both windage and elevation. The sights are similar to those on some Heckler & Koch
                    weapons, such as the HK G3 or HK MP5. The sights consist of a rear, rotating diopter drum soldered
                    to the receiver and a hooded front post installed in the gas block. The rear sight has an open notch
                    setting marked "1" designed for immediate firing up to 100 m but also contains apertures with
                    settings "2", "3" and "4" corresponding to 200, 300 and 400 m firing ranges. The 400 m setting has a
                    removable iris for sportive shooting. The sights are adjustable via micrometer screws with windage
                    and elevation increments of 0.15 mil (≈0.52 moa), or 15 mm (0.6 in) at 100 m. For night use, the
                    dedicated "1" notch setting in the rear sight drum is provided with two self-luminous
                    tritium-powered inserts fitted laterally on each side of the notch and additionally in a flip-up
                    post attached to the foresight. When firing rifle grenades the front sight hood is aligned with the
                    uppermost edge of the grenade's warhead, this provides an estimated point of impact up to 75 m. The
                    rifle grenades intended for this purpose were FN/Luchaire Type 58-N bullet-though anti-tank
                    grenades.
                    For designated marksman use, the SG 550 is equipped with a Kern 4×24 telescopic sight on a
                    quick-detachable mount.[citation needed] The sight weighs 730 g (26 oz) and includes a variety of
                    features, such as STANAG 2324/MIL-STD-1913 compliant mounting components, a Bullet Drop Compensation
                    (BDC) elevation adjustment knob for ranges from 100 to 600 m, a tritium-illuminated reticle that
                    enables target acquisition in low-light conditions and a diopter eyesight correction adjustment.
                    Included with the sight is a lens hood for mounting on the ocular that reduces image
                    quality-impairing stray light and a gray filter for glare reduction. The basic model of this optical
                    sight was already used on the Stgw 57.

                <h3>ACCESSORIES</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Both the rifle and carbine come standard with a spare magazine, sling, cleaning kit and a loading
                    aid for rapid magazine filling.

                    The full-sized SG 550/551 will accept SIG's 40 mm GL 5040/5140 grenade launcher (Swiss military
                    designation: 40 mm Gewehraufsatz 97), which is mounted under the barrel via an eccentric latch and
                    replaces the lower handguard. The grenade launcher is a single-shot breech-loaded weapon that is
                    supplied with a leaf sight that attaches to the rifle's rear sight base and enables accurate firing
                    out to 200 m. The lightweight aluminium launcher weighs 1.7 kg (3.7 lb) unloaded, and is operated
                    independently of the rifle. It can use a wide array of 40×46mm grenades, including extended range
                    high-pressure types and non-lethal baton or anti-riot projectiles. The compact SG 552/553 can be
                    fitted with smaller GL 5340 underbarrel grenade launcher.
                    An Stgw 90 bayonet can also be mounted to the rifle. The bayonet has an overall length of 310 mm and
                    a muzzle ring diameter of 22 mm. The 177 mm long blade is single-edged and it has no fuller. The
                    bayonets are manufactured exclusively for the Swiss Army by Victorinox and in the past by Wenger
                    until Victorinox acquired Wenger in 2005. With a proper lug adaptor, the rifle will also accept a
                    NATO-pattern KCB-77 (made originally by Carl Eickhorn of Solingen, West Germany) or the American M9.

                <h3>SG 551</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The SG 551 carbine has a short pattern 363 mm (14.3 in) barrel, gas tube and piston compared to the SG 550. The SG 551 series rifles have a 466 mm (18.3 in) long sight radius. The handguards were also changed and the bipod removed. The SG 551 cannot be used with a bayonet or fire rifle grenades. The SG 551 comes in several specialized variants designed for use with security and special forces.
                     Among those variants are:
                     <ul>
                        <li><b>SG 551-1P</b> police carbine, designed to engage point targets out to 300 m; equipped with a Hensoldt 6x42 BL telescopic sight and detachable cheek riser.</li>
                        <li><b>SG 551 SWAT</b> carbine, coated with a corrosion-resistant finish and equipped with an optical sight mount used with a wide array of sights, and can also accept mission-critical accessories such as a bipod, laser pointer or tactical light.</li>
                        <li><b>SG 551 LB</b> carbine with an extended 454 mm (17.9 in) barrel that enables the use of rifle grenades and a bayonet.</li>
                     </ul>
                </p><br>

                <h3>SG 552 Commando</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The compact SG 552 Commando (full designation as the 552-2P) carbine was released in July 1998. It has a shorter 226 mm (8.9 in) barrel (with an open, 3-prong flash suppressor) and gas tube, ventilated handguards and a redesigned bolt carrier group that was integrated with the piston rod to form a single moving assembly. The SG 552 series rifles have a 360 mm (14.2 in) long sight radius. The return mechanism has been moved to the rear of the receiver housing and its recoil spring is guided in a way analogous to that of the AK-47: on a steel guide rod (later models feature a polymer guide rod) resting against the lower receiver's rear surface under tension of the compressed recoil spring. Like the SG 550/551, this model can accept rails and accessories enabling the use of optics. A long barrel version of the SG 552 known as the SG 552 LB incorporates a 346 mm (13.6 in) barrel with provision to fire rifle grenades and support a bayonet. The SG 552 models were discontinued in 2008 and replaced by the SG 553. Upgrade part kits are available to convert a SG 552 in to a SG 553.

                <h3>SG 553</h3>

                <p>The SG 553 is an improved version of the SG 552 and was released in 2008. Even though it mostly resembles the SG 552, the SG 553 has one key advantage, the recoil spring is now wrapped around the piston rod as in the SG 550/551 models, which address several reliability issues encountered in the SG 552 and also allows the usage of the standard SG 550/551 charging handle. The SG 553 series rifles have a 339 mm (13.3 in) long sight radius. A long barrel version of the SG 553 known as the SG 553 LB incorporates a 347 mm (13.7 in) barrel with provision to fire rifle grenades and support a bayonet. Further factory options for the SG 553 rifle series are an integrated receiver Picatinny rail and an adjustable butt stock. The SG 553 R is a variant chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge fed from AK family box magazines. There is also a .300 AAC Blackout variant of the SG 553 known as the SG 553 BK which was first shown at IWA OutdoorClassics in 2016.</p><br>
           
                <h3>SG 552-A1</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The SG 552-A1 is a SG 552 rifle that has been modified to function like the SG 553. The modifications are available as a conversion kit that includes a new bolt carrier, charging handle, recoil spring and gas tube.

                <h3>SG 550-1 Sniper</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Another member of the SG 550 family is the SG 550-1 Sniper variant designed at the request of the Swiss Police. Introduced in 1988, This accurized rifle has a refined two-stage trigger (the pull force was reduced from 35 N (7.9 lbf) to 15 N (3.4 lbf), a heavy, hammer-forged 650 mm (25.6 in) long barrel with a 254 mm (1:10 in) rifling twist rate (it has no flash hider) and is used exclusively with telescopic sights. The new folding stock has an adjustable cheek piece and a spacer system on the butt, the ergonomic pistol grip's angle of inclination can be regulated, the forend was shortened, and the bipod features a height and cant adjustment mechanism. This model is no longer in production.
