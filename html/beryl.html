                <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2><br>
                <p>Development work on a new service rifle (both a standard and carbine variant) adapted to use the
                    intermediate 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge had been undertaken in 1995, however a functioning 5.56 mm
                    rifle and carbine variant had already been available in Radom since 1991, known as the wz. 1991 (a
                    rechambered wz. 88 Tantal rifle). The new weapon's specifications were approved in February 1995 and
                    in December the same year, a prototype production batch consisting of 11 Beryl rifles was produced.
                    In 1997 the weapon had been successfully evaluated and adopted into service as the 5,56 mm karabinek
                    szturmowy wz. 1996 ("assault carbine pattern 1996").
                    The Beryl subsequently became the standard Polish rifle. In 2011, there were more than 45,000 in the
                    inventory, accounting for about half of the assault rifles in the Polish Army. On May 25, 2016, FB
                    "Łucznik" Radom announced an order from the Polish Army for 26,000 Beryls and Mini-Beryls, though
                    did not break it down by system.
                    Apart from Poland, 80 wz. 96A Beryls and 10 wz. 96A Mini Beryls are used by Lithuania (donated in
                    May 2000 by Poland, including 10 rifles with Pallad grenade launcher and 10 rifles with CWL-1 scope
                    with integrated laser rangefinder). Until 2002/2003 they were equipment of a special forces unit SOJ
                    Aitvaras, operating in Afghanistan.
                </p><br>

                <h2> DESIGN </h2><br>
                <p>
                    The Beryl's design layout and system of operation are similar to those of the Tantal rifle, and the
                    principal differences, resulting primarily from using a different cartridge, include the following
                    components: the barrel, receiver housing, buttstock, foregrip, muzzle device, sight system and
                    magazine. With an adapter, it can use M16 NATO standard magazine.
                    The 457 mm-long barrel, has six right-hand grooves and a 228 mm (1:9 in) twist rate. The barrel's
                    external profile (from the breech to the front sight base) is identical to the Tantal's barrel, but
                    the length from the foresight base has a visible tapered contour with a decreasing diameter towards
                    the muzzle end, used to mount a flash suppressor.
                    The flash hider can be used to mount and launch rifle grenades. The flash hider has a slight taper
                    at the front that supports a bayonet and a little further to the rear – six side ports arranged in
                    pairs. These ports are placed asymmetrically around the circumference of the flash hider and
                    stabilize the weapon during continuous fire. Internally the flash suppressor features threading at
                    the muzzle used to screw-in a blank firing attachment. Located mid-length on the flash hider is a
                    cut-out with a ring retainer spring that secures a rifle grenade to the barrel.
                    The receiver housing contains several modifications over the receiver of the wz. 1988 rifle. It uses
                    a reinforced rear stock trunnion, adapted for the new shoulder stock and a top-mounted Picatinny
                    rail for mounting optical sights.
                    The side-folding tubular metal stock is coated with a thermal polymer shrink film. It has a metal
                    shoulder stop covered with a rubber recoil pad. More recent models come with a collapsible stock
                    (see picture of wz. 2004 model on right side of page).
                    The standard lower handguard features an angled rib pattern designed to enhance gripping by the
                    support hand. The rear of the handguard features two molded notches that enable the 40 mm wz. 1974
                    grenade launcher to be mounted under the barrel (early versions of the wz. 1996 lacked these
                    notches, fitted instead with handguards with lateral grooves). Some Beryl handguards are equipped
                    with short Picatinny rails and an integral vertical foregrip.
                    The Beryl's sighting system is very similar to the setup used on the Tantal, it does however differ
                    with the addition of twin cuts made into the sides of rear sight base that are used to fasten a
                    bracket for mounting the following optical sights: the passive PCS-6 night sight, a CK-3 reflex
                    optical collimator (red dot sight), LKA-4 telescopic sight and CWL-1 scope with integrated laser
                    rangefinder. However, the most used additional sight for Beryl is EOTech 552 holographic weapon
                    sight and PCS-5M passive night sight. PCS-6 and CWL-1 are introduced in small number.
                    The weapon's unique magazine is molded from plastic and is not interchangeable with magazines from
                    the kbk wz. 1988 Tantal.

                    The Beryl has a long, trapezoid-shaped selector switch, similar to those found on the AK-47 or
                    almost all of the AK series.
                    The Beryl fires 5.56×45mm ammunition with a steel-core standard round, a tracer cartridge and a
                    training slug, which are produced by Zakłady Metalowe Mesko in the town of Skarżysko-Kamienna.
                    Standard equipment shipped with the rifle includes: three spare magazines, four 15-round stripper
                    clips, a stripper clip guide, bayonet, cleaning kit, lubricant bottle, cleaning rod (two-piece,
                    stored in the cleaning kit pouch), sling, a magazine pouch and bipod. The rifle can also be fitted
                    with a mounting system for optical sights and a blank-firing adaptor.

                    The Beryl was used to create a carbine variant known as the Mini-Beryl.
