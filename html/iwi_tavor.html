                <h2>IWI Tavor TAR-21</h2><br>
                <p>The IWI Tavor TAR-21 is an Israeli bullpup assault rifle chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO caliber with a selective fire system, selecting between semi-automatic mode and full automatic fire mode. The Tavor is designed and produced by Israel Weapon Industries (IWI). It is produced in two main variants: the TAR-21 and the CTAR-21.

                    Built around a long-stroke piston system (as found in the M1 Garand and AK-47), the Tavor is designed to maximize reliability, durability, simplicity of design, and ease of maintenance, particularly under adverse or battlefield conditions.
                    In 2009, the Tavor X95 (also known as the Micro Tavor or MTAR) was selected by the Israeli Defense Forces to gradually replace the M16 assault rifle and M4 carbine variants as the standard-issued weapon of the Israeli infantry by the end of 2018. The first X95 bullpup rifles were issued to infantry units in 2013. Both the TAR-21 and X95 are part of the Tavor family of rifles, along with the Tavor 7.

                    In the beginning of September 2021, there were conflicting reports in Israeli media whether the IDF was planning to end further acquisition of the Tavor and Micro and replace it with M4s for front-line units. On 7 September, a report was published on the IDF's Hebrew website that the IDF plans to continue acquiring the Micro Tavor and equipping combat units with it.
                </p><br>

                <h2>HISTORY</h2><br>
                <p>Israel Military Industries (the small arms branch of IMI was privatized into Israel Weapon Industries) initiated the Tavor development team in 1995, under the direction of gun designer Zalmen Shebs.

                    The objective of the project was to create an assault rifle that was more reliable, durable, and easier to maintain than the M4A1 carbine, while also being better suited to close-quarters combat and mechanized infantry roles. As a result, they hoped that the weapon would be officially adopted by the Israel Defense Forces.
                    Due to the military's close-quarters and mechanized infantry requirements, the project team selected a bullpup design that would allow the weapon to be compact while keeping a long barrel able to achieve ballistically favorable high muzzle velocities.[9] A long-stroke piston system, similar to that found in the AK-47 and M1 Garand, was selected to ensure the weapon's reliability under adverse conditions.
                </p><br>

                <h2>Trials and Use in ISRAEL</h2><br>
                <p>
                    The Tavor prevailed over the M4A1 in a series of trials conducted during 2001 and 2002. Qualities tested included Mean Rounds Between Failures (MRBF), reliability, ergonomics during long marches, and ease-of-maintenance.
                    As part of initial testing by Israel Defense Forces' infantry units, the TAR-21 was distributed to members of the training company of the Tzabar Battalion from the Givati Brigade who were drafted in August 2001. They received their rifles in November 2001 during basic training. Initial testing results were favorable – the TAR-21 was found to be significantly more accurate and reliable (as well as more comfortable) than the M4 during extensive field testing.
                    Issues with fine sand entering the Tavor's chamber, which were identified over the two years of testing, were rectified by numerous small adjustments. A number of other improvements and changes to the design were also made between 2001 and 2009. The Tavor CTAR-21 saw combat service in Operation Cast Lead, used by Givati Brigade and Golani Brigade, and the soldiers reported the Tavor bullpup assault rifles functioned flawlessly.
                    In November 2009, the IDF announced that the X95 would become the standard infantry weapon of the IDF, with the addition of an integrated grenade launcher. A gradual changeover has begun in 2006 and expected completion among front line troops was to be by the end of 2018.
                    In December 2012, the IDF announced that they would begin equipping and training their new reserve forces with the X95, starting in 2013, with the switch-over by the end of 2018.

The first Tavor X95s were issued to new recruits of a main IDF infantry brigade in 2013, replacing the M16. In 2014 the IDF announced that in the future (from as early as the end of 2014) some infantry units could start to be issued some numbers of an improved X95, which will have a longer 38 cm (15 in) barrel (instead of the original 33 cm barrel) and a lighter trigger pull.

                <h2>VARIANTS</h2><br>
                <h3>TAR-21</h3><br>
                <p>The Tavor TAR-21 is the standard variant with a 457 mm (18 in) long barrel.

                    The Israeli firearm manufacturer, Israel Weapon Industries produces the Tavor TAR-21 in different variations.
                </p><br>

                <h3>GTAR-21</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The GTAR-21 has a notched barrel, to accept an M203 40 mm under-barrel grenade launcher.
                </p><br>

                <h3>CTAR-21</h3><br>
                <p>The CTAR-21 is a compact shorter 380 mm (15 in) barrel variant intended for commandos and special forces, but has become more favored than the standard TAR-21 throughout the IDF.</p><br>

                <h3>STAR-21</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The STAR-21 is a designated marksman variant with folding under-barrel bipod and Trijicon ACOG 4× magnification sight.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Tavor X95 (MTAR-21)</h3><br>
                <p>The Tavor X95 (also referred to as the MTAR-21) is the variant of the Tavor that was selected as the future standard infantry weapon of the IDF in 2009.  In 2013, the X95 was issued for the first time as the standard infantry weapon to recruits of the Givati Brigade.

                    With the use of a relatively simple conversion kit, the X95 can be converted from a 5.56 mm assault rifle to a 9 mm submachine gun. A suppressor can also be added to the weapon, as part of the 9 mm conversion kit. A grenade launcher can also be attached to the X95.</p><br>
