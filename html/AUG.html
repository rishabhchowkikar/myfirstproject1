                <h2>Steyr AUG</h2> <br>
                <p>The Steyr AUG (German: Armee-Universal-Gewehr, lit. 'universal army rifle') is an Austrian bullpup
                    assault rifle chambered for the 5.56×45mm NATO intermediate cartridge, designed in the 1960s by
                    Steyr-Daimler-Puch, and now manufactured by Steyr Arms GmbH & Co KG.
                    It was adopted by the Austrian Army in 1978 as the StG 77 (Sturmgewehr 77), where it replaced the
                    7.62×51mm NATO StG 58 automatic rifle (a licence-built FN FAL). In production since 1978, it is the
                    standard small arm of the Bundesheer and various Austrian federal police units, and its variants
                    have also been adopted by the armed forces of dozens of countries, with some using it as a
                    standard-issue service rifle.
                    Steyr AUG importation into the United States began in the 1980s as the AUG/SA (SA denoting
                    semiautomatic). President George H.W. Bush banned the AUG via an executive order under the 1989
                    Assault Weapon Import Ban. Six years into the ban, AUG buyers gained a reprieve as cosmetic changes
                    to the carbine's design allowed importation once again. Changes included the pistol grip being
                    changed into a thumbhole stock, and the gun barrel left unthreaded to prevent attachment of flash
                    hiders and suppressors. The ban sunsetted in 2004, and in 2008 Steyr Arms worked with Sabre Defense
                    to produce parts legally in the U.S.

                </p><br>
                <h2>DESIGN DETAILS</h2> <br>
                <p>The Steyr AUG is a selective-fire, bullpup weapon with a conventional gas-piston-operated action that
                    fires from a closed bolt. It is designed as a Modular Weapon System that could be quickly configured
                    as a rifle, a carbine, a sniper rifle, a sub-machine gun and even an open-bolt squad automatic
                    weapon. The AUG employs a very high level of advanced firearms technology and is made with the
                    extensive use of polymers and aluminium components. It is chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO cartridge and
                    has the standard 1:9 rifling twist that will stabilise both SS109/M855 and M193 rounds.
                    Some nations including Australia, Ireland and New Zealand use a version with a 1:7 twist optimised
                    for the SS109 NATO round. The submachine gun variants are chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum. The AUG
                    consists of six interchangeable assemblies: the barrel, receiver with integrated telescopic sight or
                    Picatinny rail, bolt carrier assembly, trigger mechanism, stock and magazine.
                </p><br>

                <h3>OPERATING MECHANISM</h3><br>
                <p>The AUG has a rotating bolt that features 7 radial locking lugs and is unlocked by means of a pin on
                    the bolt body and a recessed camming guide machined into the bolt carrier. The bolt carrier itself
                    is guided by two guide rods brazed to it and these rods run inside steel bearings in the receiver.
                    The guide rods are hollow and contain the return springs. The bolt also contains a claw extractor
                    that forms the eighth locking lug and a spring-loaded "bump"-type casing ejector.
                    The gas cylinder is offset to the right side of the barrel and works with one of the two guide rods.
                    The AUG uses a short-stroke piston system where the right guide rod serves as the action rod,
                    transmitting the rearward motion of the gas-driven piston to the bolt carrier. The left-hand rod
                    provides retracting handle pressure when connected by the forward assist and can also be utilised as
                    a reamer to remove fouling in the gas cylinder. The firearm uses a 3-position gas valve. The first
                    setting, marked with a small dot, is used for normal operation. The second setting, illustrated with
                    a large dot, indicates fouled conditions. The third, "GR" closed position is used to launch rifle
                    grenades (of the non-bullet trap type).
                    The AUG is hammer-fired and the firing mechanism is contained in the rear of the stock, near the
                    butt, covered by a synthetic rubber shoulder plate. The hammer group is made entirely of plastics
                    except for the springs and pins and is contained in an open-topped plastic box which lies between
                    the magazine and the buttplate. During firing the recoiling bolt group travels over the top of it,
                    resetting the hammer. Since the trigger is located some distance away, it transmits its energy
                    through a sear lever which passes by the side of the magazine. The firing pin is operated by a
                    plastic hammer under pressure from a coil spring.
                </p><br>

                <h2>ENGINEERING</h2><br>
                <p>The quick-change barrel used in the AUG is cold hammer-forged by GFM-GmbH of Steyr Austria for
                    increased precision and durability, its bore, chamber and certain components of the gas system are
                    chrome-plated (currently nitrided on US market rifles). The standard rifle-length barrel features 6
                    right-hand grooves and a rifling twist rate of 228 mm (1:9 in). An external sleeve is shrunk on to
                    the barrel and carries the gas port and cylinder, gas valve and forward grip hinge jaw. There is a
                    short cylinder which contains a piston and its associated return spring. The barrel locks into a
                    steel insert inside the receiver through a system of eight lugs arranged around the chamber end and
                    is equipped with a folding, vertical grip that helps to pivot and withdraw the barrel during barrel
                    changes. The most compact of the barrels has a fixed vertical grip.
                    The receiver housing is a steel-reinforced aluminium extrusion finished with a baked enamel coating.
                    It holds the steel bearings for the barrel lugs and the guide rods. The non-reciprocating plastic
                    cocking handle works in a slot on the left side of the receiver and is connected to the bolt
                    carrier's left guide rod. The cocking handle has a forward assist feature—alternatively called a
                    "silent cocking device"—used for pushing the bolt shut without recocking the rifle. A bolt hold-open
                    device locks the bolt carrier assembly back after the last round has been fired. The newer AUG A3s
                    possess a bolt release button, prior to this development all AUGs and the USR required the cocking
                    handle being retracted to release the bolt group after a new magazine has been inserted. Older
                    versions of the AUG can be upgraded to use the newer A3 stock and hammer pack.
                    The rifle's stock is made from fibreglass-reinforced polyamide 66. At the forward end is the pistol
                    grip with an enlarged forward trigger guard completely enclosing the firing hand that allows the
                    rifle to be operated with winter gloves. The trigger is hung permanently on the pistol grip,
                    together with its two operating rods which run in guides past the magazine housing. Behind that is
                    the locking catch for the stock group. Pressing this to the right will separate the receiver and
                    stock. The magazine catch is behind the housing, on the underside of the stock. Above the housing
                    are the two ejector openings, one of which is always covered by a removable strip of plastic. The
                    rear of the stock forms the actual shoulder rest which contains the hammer unit and the end of the
                    bolt path. The butt is closed by an endplate which is held in place by the rear sling swivel. This
                    swivel is attached to a pin which pushes in across the butt and secures the plate. There is a cavity
                    under the buttplate that holds a cleaning kit.

                <h2>MILITARY ADOPTION</h2><br>
                <h3>AUSTRALIAN MILITARY</h3><br>
                <p>The Australian Army adopted the Steyr AUG A1 and designated it as the F88 Austeyr. It has a cyclic
                    rate of fire of around 680–850 rounds per minute.
                    The Australian F88 Austeyr was tested with a new grenade launcher specifically designed for it
                    called the ML40AUS GLA (Grenade Launcher Assembly), one of the lightest underbarrel grenade
                    launchers at less than 1 kg (2.2 lb) due to steel, aluminium, and synthetic parts. The GLA is
                    mounted on the rifle's bottom accessory rail with the trigger moving through a removable plug in the
                    trigger guard that allows for operation of the launcher inside of it, moving it further back than
                    other launchers to maintain centre of balance and improve handling. The ML40AUS differs from the
                    M203 by having a side-opening breech to allow for longer grenade rounds, a cross-bolt safety, and a
                    new quadrant sight that mounts to the top rail alongside the rifle's optics. On 21 January 2014
                    however, Thales announced they had instead selected the Steyr SL40 grenade launcher due to
                    "significant" engineering concerns with the ML40AUS. The SL40 is a derivative of the Steyr GL40
                    launcher designed specifically for the EF88. It weighs 1.025 kg (2.26 lb) and has a 180 mm (7.1 in)
                    long barrel. Though marginally heavier than the ML40AUS, it has the same attachment, firing
                    mechanism, and control layout. Within the Australian Defence Force, there has been some discussion
                    about the suitability of the F88 when compared against variants of the M4 such as the MCX.

                <h2>AUSTRIAN MILITARY</h2><br>
                <p>The Austrian Army adopted the Steyr AUG in 1978 and designated it as the Sturmgewehr 77 (StG 77).
                <ul>
                    <li>The StG 77 is the Austrian Army's designation for the Steyr AUG.</li>
                    <li>The StG 77 A2 is the Austrian Army's designation for the Steyr AUG A3 SF. It was adopted by the
                        Austrian Special Forces (Jagdkommando) in late 2007.</li>
                    <li>The StG 77 KPE is the Austrian Army's designation for an upgraded StG 77. Where the A1 housing
                        group was replaced with the A3 SF housing and was adopted in 2017.</li>
                    <li>The StG 77 A1 MP is the Austrian Army designation for the StG 77 used by military police. The
                        rifles differ from the standard StG 77 by having a Picatinny rail for an Aimpoint Micro T1 Red
                        Dot Sight and magnifier, a flash hider from Ase-Utra, and Rheinmetall Vario Ray laser and light
                        module mounted on the right side. Adopted in 2018.</li>
                </ul>
                </p><br>
                <h3>IRISH MILITARY</h3><br>
                <p>The Steyr AUG Mod 14 is an AUG A1 upgraded by the Irish Army, which was possible due to the
                    modularity of the rifle. It allowed the Irish Army to make modernisation upgrades. They replaced the
                    original A1 housing/receiver group (with 1.5× optical sight) with an A3 housing/receiver group (with
                    MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail on top and right side) allowing a modern optical sight to be fitted. The
                    Trijicon ACOG 4× sight was selected as the new optical sight of the rifle. The rifle features the
                    ALO "automatic lockout" trigger, which can also be found in the Australian and New Zealand versions.
                    In 2014, they began issuing the rifle to its operational units.</p><br>
                <h3>NEW ZEALAND MILITARY</h3><br>
                <p>The New Zealand Defence Force had adopted the F88 Austeyr and designated it as the IW Steyr
                    (Individual Weapon Steyr). However the New Zealand Defence Force has since adopted the Lewis Machine
                    and Tool, Mars-L 5.56mm rifle and phased out the IW Steyr. New Zealand variants of the Steyr were
                    equipped with a single-stage trigger and a two-position safety. The sight added a crosshair to the
                    circle reticule. New Zealand issued both factory and locally modified carbines alongside the
                    full-length rifle variant.</p><br>


                <h2>VARIANTS</h2><br>
                <h3>AUG</h3><br>
                <p>The Steyr AUG is a bullpup assault rifle chambered in 5.56×45mm NATO. It was introduced in 1978 and
                    was adopted by the Austrian Army and was designated as the StG 77 in 1978, then it was later adopted
                    by several military agencies around the world.
                <ul>
                    <li>The Steyr AUG A1 is an improved variant of the AUG and was introduced in 1982. It is available
                        with a choice of olive or black furniture.</li>
                    <li>The Steyr AUG M203 is an AUG A1 fitted with the M203 grenade launcher.</li>
                    <li>The Steyr AUG AG-C is an AUG A1 fitted with the AG-C grenade launcher.</li>
                    <li>The Steyr AUG A2 features a redesigned charging handle and a detachable telescopic sight which
                        can be replaced with a MIL-STD-1913 rail. Due to its modularity, a 24-inch barrel can be used
                        and a Picatinny rail section can be fitted instead of the folding grip, where a bipod can be
                        installed. The rifle was introduced in December 1997.</li>
                    <li>The Steyr AUG A3 features a MIL-STD-1913 rail on top of the receiver and an external bolt
                        release.</li>
                    <li>The Steyr AUG A3 SF features an MIL-STD-1913 rails mounted on the telescopic sight and on the
                        right side of the receiver, and includes an external bolt release. The integrated telescopic
                        sight is offered in 1.5× or 3× magnification.</li>
                    <li>The Steyr AUG A3-CQC was a prototype development of the AUG A3 and was first displayed by Steyr
                        at the SHOT Show 2006. It differs in having a railed handguard attached ahead of the receiver.
                        Due to the need to remove this extra railed section in order to strip the rifle for cleaning, it
                        featured a quick detach lever mounted on the left side to remove the rail. Due to the concerns
                        over the extra cost and weight, along with potential issues with the reliability and consistency
                        of the detachable handguard, the prototypes received little interest and were last seen promoted
                        by Steyr in 2008 and likely has been cancelled. In total only 5 prototypes were made, four with
                        standard 18-inch barrels, and one with a longer heavy marksman barrel and a 20-round magazine.
                        In 2012 the American company PJA obtained the 5 original prototypes from Steyr and reverse
                        engineered them in order to produce a US-made AUG A3-CQC and conversion kits.</li>
                </ul>
                </p><br>
                <h3>AUG HBAR</h3><br>
                <p>The Steyr AUG HBAR (Heavy Barreled Automatic Rifle) is a longer heavier-barreled variant of the
                    standard AUG for use as a light machine gun or squad automatic weapon. It uses the standard AUG
                    receiver with 1.5× magnification scope. It can be modified to fire from an open bolt to allow
                    sustained fire. To accomplish this, a modified bolt carrier, striker and trigger mechanism with sear
                    are used.

                    The Steyr AUG HBAR-T (Heavy Barreled Automatic Rifle-Telescope) is a designated marksman
                    configuration of the HBAR that features a special receiver with a STANAG scope mount system usually
                    fitted with a Schmidt & Bender 4x25, or a Kahles ZF69 6×42 optical sight.</p><br>

                <h3>AUG PARA</h3><br>
                <p>The Steyr AUG Para also known as the AUG SMG or AUG 9mm, is a submachine gun variant of the AUG
                    chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge and has been produced since 1988. It differs from the rifle
                    variants by having a different barrel, bolt and magazine. It is an automatic, blowback-operated
                    model that fires from a closed bolt, and does not use the rifle's gas system. Unlike the rifle
                    variants, it has a unique 420 mm (16.5 in) barrel with six right-hand grooves at a 250 mm (1:9.8 in)
                    rifling twist rate, with a recoil compensator, a slightly different charging handle and a magazine
                    well adapter enabling the use of proprietary 25-round box magazines. The original design of the AUG
                    9mm, known as the MP88, used Steyr MPi 69 magazines. A conversion kit used to transform any assault
                    rifle configuration into the submachine gun configuration is also available. The conversion kit
                    consists of a barrel, bolt, adapter insert and magazine.
                <ul>
                    <li>The Steyr AUG A3 Para XS is a 9mm variant of the AUG A3. It features a 325 mm (12.8 in) barrel
                        and a Picatinny rail system.</li>
                    <li>The Steyr AUG 40 is a .40 S&W variant of the AUG Para that uses Glock compatible double stack
                        .40 S&W magazines.</li>
                </ul>
                </p><br>

                <h3>AUG CLONES</h3><br>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The STG-556 was introduced at the 2007 SHOT Show, it was manufactured by Microtech Small Arms
                        Research Inc. (a subsidiary of Microtech Knives) an AUG A1 clone significantly re-engineered in
                        its working system and principle as it features a bolt hold-open device as seen on the M16
                        rifle; otherwise the MSAR STG-556 retains the original AUG features, such as feeding from
                        proprietary translucent plastic magazines and having the quick-change barrel option. The STG-556
                        can be converted from either having a telescopic sight or a MIL-STD-1913 rail. It is available
                        in either civilian (semi-automatic only) configuration, and military and law enforcement
                        (selective fire) configuration.</li>
                    <li>The AXR was revealed at the 2007 SHOT Show, the TPD USA AXR was manufactured by Tactical
                        Products Design Inc. as an AUG A2 clone capable of semi-automatic only fire, aimed for both the
                        civilian and law enforcement markets, and fed by STANAG magazines; the manufacturer sells clear
                        plastic magazines which are STANAG 4179 compliant and will readily fit in any rifle with a
                        compatible magazine catch.[48] The rifle does not have the integral scope, allowing users to use
                        any kind of scopes or laser sights on the Picatinny railing.</li>
                    <li>The Type 68 is a Taiwanese copy of the AUG with notable differences including a smaller trigger
                        guard and the use of iron sights instead of the original's telescopic sight (although optical
                        sights can still be optionally mounted on the carrying handle). Developed as a potential
                        alternative to the T65 assault rifle and (in the form of a heavy-barrel variant) replacement to
                        the Type 57A squad automatic rifle (licence-built selective fire M14A1), it ultimately did not
                        enter service after the ROC military decided to adopt light machineguns (Minimi and T75) as
                        their future squad automatic weapons.</li>
                </ul>
