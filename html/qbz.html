                <h2>QBZ-95</h2><br>
                <p>The Type 95 automatic rifle QBZ-95 is a bullpup assault rifle designed and manufactured by Norinco,
                    and issued since 1995 as the service rifle for the People's Liberation Army, People's Armed Police
                    and various paramilitary law enforcement agencies in the People's Republic of China. The rifle's
                    designation "QBZ" stands for "'light weapon' (Qīng Wŭqì)—'rifle' (Bùqiāng)—'automatic' (Zìdòng)", in
                    keeping with the coding standards of the Chinese defense industry.
                    The QBZ-95 is the flagship of the Type 95 gun family , a family of firearms sharing a common
                    receiver design, which includes a standard rifle, a carbine and light support weapon variants. It
                    fires the 5.8×42mm DBP87, an indigenous intermediate cartridge.

                    An export version chambered for 5.56×45mm NATO, the QBZ-97, is available for sale in Canada and
                    various countries in Southeast Asia, South Asia and East Africa.
                </p><br>
                <h2>DEVELOPMENT</h2><br>
                <p>The Chinese military started to develop small-caliber weapons in 1971. The Type 87, a modification
                    based on the Type 81 assault rifle, was developed in the 1980s and entered service in 1987. The Type
                    87 was put in limited service. Bullpup configurations were also experimented with in the early
                    1980s, resulting in the WTC-1 and WTC-2 bullpup prototypes in 1983 and the Type 86 bullpup rifle in
                    1986. In 1989, the People's Liberation Army requested that Norinco develop a new family of
                    small-caliber firearms with improved reliability and accuracy, adaptability to different roles, and
                    configurability to different tactical applications.
                    Duo Yingxian, who is credited for the design of QBZ-95, was recruited to serve as the project head
                    in 1991. He was given four years for the development. Two years were spent on the design, alongside
                    two years of field tests. Initial production started in 1995.
                    The QBZ-95 was first observed outside China on 1 July 1997, when the United Kingdom transferred the
                    sovereignty of Hong Kong to the People's Republic of China. It is a modern weapon system in a
                    bullpup configuration, where the weapon's action and magazine are located behind the grip and
                    trigger assembly. The weapon was designed to replace the standard-issue Type 81 assault rifle. The
                    QBZ-95 had replaced the Type 81 in frontline units by 2006, and is gradually replacing it in
                    second-line units and the People's Armed Police.
                    An improved version called the "QBZ-95-1" was first seen undergoing trials in early 2010. The first
                    formal public display of the improved version was with the Hong Kong Garrison, the first unit to
                    receive the original QBZ-95, in a military parade in July 2012. Some improvements were ergonomic,
                    with the safety switch moved to above the pistol grip and the right-sided ejection port moved
                    forward with ejection of cartridges at an angle to allow left-handed firing. Unlike previous DBP87
                    and DBP85 5.8×42mm rounds, it fires better-quality DBP10 ammunition with non-corrosive primers,
                    clean-burning propellant, and copper-coated steel casings with copper-alloy-jacketed hardened
                    steel-cored bullets.
                    The QBZ-95-1 has a longer, heavier barrel and redesigned muzzle brake, a diamond-shaped
                    cross-section on the handguard to disperse heat, a stronger buttstock and a redesigned trigger
                    guard. The carrying handle was lowered to better position optics on the quick-releasable modified
                    dovetail rail, and a pair of short rails at the sight's base allows for tactical accessories to be
                    mounted. Some Chinese special forces have been seen equipped with customized QBZ-95-1 rifle
                    variants.
                </p><br>

                <h2>ACCESSORIES</h2><br>
                <h3>GRENADE LAUNCHERS</h3><br>
                <p>The QBZ-95 can launch rifle grenades from the barrel using blank ammunition. It can also mount the
                    QLG-91B (Type 91B) under-barrel grenade launcher. This 35 mm launcher weighs 1.45 kg (3.2 lb) and is
                    310 mm (12 in) long. It loads from the breech and fires grenades at 75 m/s (250 ft/s). Various
                    lethal and non-lethal rounds are available including high explosive, tear gas, and illumination.
                    Other options include the QLG-10 and QLG-10A 35 mm grenade launchers, which both can be mounted on
                    the QBZ-95-1, QBZ-95-1, and QBZ-95B-1. The QLG-10/A is the same length and weighs the same as the
                    QLG91B, but differs in that it fires caseless ammunition. It is modeled after the Russian GP-25 and
                    fires DFS-10 grenades. The DFS-10 has the same caseless design as the Russian VOG-25 where the base
                    of the round is the propellant and nothing is left in the barrel after firing. The QLG10A launcher
                    is loaded from its muzzle and the shell has pre-engraved rifling for added stabilization. It is
                    aimed with iron sights mounted to the left above the barrel, but a red dot sight can be installed
                    over the sight base.
                    The DFS-10 round weighs 169 g (6.0 oz), has a velocity of 78 m/s (260 ft/s), and has an effective
                    range of 430 meters. Warheads include high explosive fragmentation, high explosive dual-purpose,
                    inert practice, and less-lethal riot control versions.
                </p><br>

                <h3>BAYONET</h3><br>
                <p>The QBZ-95 can be mounted with the Type 87 bayonet, which is based on the M9 bayonet.</p><br>

                <h3>SIGHTS</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Soldiers can mount optical sights for their rifles, due to a dovetail rail built into the carrying
                    handle. The QBZ-95 can also use YMA95 and YMA95-1 scopes.

                    QBZ-95 and QBZ-95–1 series rifles can also be fitted with improved QMK-171 3x scopes. The QMK-171
                    shares the same design as the QMK-152 scope fitted with the QBZ-191, though the QMK-152 only fits on
                    picatinny rails, whereas the QMK-171 has quick-lock lever for dovetail rails.
                </p><br>

                <h3>PICATINNY RAIL</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The carrying handle can be mounted with a short picatinny rail, as well as be swapped to new upper
                    receiver with customization capabilities.

                    Most of the picatinny rail modifications for the Type 95 were designed by Wang Jie and Hong Kong
                    weapon designer Lee Ka-Ho . The ACP Peak series by Lee has a flat-top rail system while "Long Bow"
                    modifications from Wang Jie retain the shape of the carrying handle. Both modifications are fielded
                    within the Chinese police force and People's Liberation Army.
                </p><br>

                <h3>QBZ-95 (Rifle)</h3><br>
                <p>
                    This is the Chinese standard-issue version of the rifle, chambered for the 5.8×42mm DBP87 round.[27]

                    Due to issues associated with the original design, the PLA began a program to improve the Type 95.

                    Lead designer Duo Yingxian (朵英贤), now retired, stated that the project was currently in progress by
                    some of his students.
                    The goals for the Type 95 upgrade program include the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>To improve the rifle's ergonomics and fire controls</li>
                    <li>To chamber the rifle for a new type of ammunition with double the effective range</li>
                    <li>To add a quick-firing, domestically produced grenade launcher</li>
                </ul>
                </p><br>

                <h3>QBZ-95B (carbine)</h3><br>
                <p>
                    This is a shorter and lighter version of the standard rifle. From pictures seen, the QBZ-95B is seen
                    issued only to naval officers, most likely due to the limited room in naval vessels that would
                    preclude the full length rifle being used in close quarters. Its shorter barrel prevents a grenade
                    launcher or bayonet from being attached, and it has an AKS-74U style muzzle booster.

                    The carbine may also be in use with special forces. The carbine lacks a forend and instead has a
                    foregrip, with the front iron sight built into the carrying handle.

                <h3>QJB-95 light support weapon (LSW)</h3><br>
                <p>
                    This is the squad automatic weapon variant of the QBZ-95. The designation "QJB" stands for
                    "Qingwuqi, Jiqiang, Banyong", which means 'light weapon/small arm, machinegun, squad-use'. It has an
                    added bipod, a longer, heavier barrel and 80-round drum magazine to allow sustained fire, however,
                    the standard 30-round box magazine is also compatible.
                    Although the QJB-95 and QBZ-95 both take the standard 5.8×42mm DBP87 round, the QJB-95 typically
                    uses the 5.8x42mm DBP88 "heavy round" squad automatic weapon and designated marksman rifle
                    cartridges, which have longer, deeper armor penetration and better ballistics at long range. As
                    using the heavy rounds in a QBZ-95 would greatly wear the barrel in action, normal cartridges are
                    used in QBZ-95 rifles.

                    However, with the fielding of the QBZ-95-1 variant, newer and heavier DBP10 cartridges are planned
                    to become the standard ammunition for both weapons.

                <h3>QBZ-97 (5.56 mm)</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The QBZ-97 is an export version similar to the QBZ-95 in all respects except that it is chambered
                    for 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition instead of the original Chinese 5.8 mm cartridge and has a deep
                    magazine well designed to accept STANAG magazines. This rifle is currently used by Ginghis Security
                    Academy, a Chinese private security group, supplementing their QBZ-95s.

                <h3>QBZ-97A (5.56 mm Assault Rifle)</h3><br>
                <p>
                    This variant is a QBZ-97 with the addition of a three-round burst mode and a bolt hold-open device;
                    it also differs from the QBZ-95 and the QBZ-97 by the shape of its grip, now missing the "front
                    grip" part in front of the trigger guard.

                    This weapon is the only QBZ-95 variant to have seen commercial success and military use outside of
                    China.
                </p><br>

                <h3>QBZ-97B (5.56 mm carbine)</h3><br>
                <p>
                    This is the carbine version of the QBZ-97. The official distributor of the QBZ-97B assault carbine
                    on the international market, Jianshe Industries (Group) Corporation, advertises and sells it under
                    the denomination "5.56mm short automatic rifle Type NQZ03B (97)".
                </p><br>

                <h3>QBZ-95-1 (rifle)</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The new QBZ-95-1, also called the QBZ-95 "Gai" ("改"; literally: 'modified'), addresses several
                    reliability and ease-of-use issues, and has improved ergonomics.
                    The QBZ-95 variant titled "1" fires the heavier 5.8×42mm DBP10 round, and has a heavier, longer
                    barrel and a redesigned muzzle brake to use it. The "1" variant has an altered butt stock, trigger
                    guard, and a repositioned thumb fire selector switch above the pistol grip. The carrying handle has
                    retained the Chinese quick release mount rail. In addition, bullet casings eject to the front (1
                    o'clock position from the barrel) of the weapon, allowing left-handed firing. Also, there is a bolt
                    release button located behind the magazine latch. It was observed undergoing testing and evaluation
                    in early 2010.
                    It was later introduced into service, replacing the original QBZ-95 assault rifle. The original
                    QBZ-95 rifles are being handed down to second line and reserve troops, while front line troops
                    receive the QBZ-95-1.

                    The QBZ-95-1 is scheduled to be replaced in the near future by a new assault rifle known as the
                    "QBZ-191".

                <h3>QBZ-95B-1 (carbine)</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Improved version of the QBZ-95B with barrel and ergonomic enhancements of the QBZ-95-1 in the
                    carbine platform.
