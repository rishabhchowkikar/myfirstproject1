                <h2>Winchester Model 1894</h2><br>
                <p>The Winchester Model 1894 rifle (also known as the Winchester 94 or Model 94) is a lever-action
                    repeating rifle that became one of the most famous and popular hunting rifles of all time. It was
                    designed by John Browning in 1894 and originally chambered to fire two metallic black powder
                    cartridges, the .32-40 Winchester and .38-55 Winchester. It was the first rifle to chamber the
                    smokeless powder round, the .30 WCF (Winchester Center Fire, in time becoming known as the .30-30)
                    in 1895. In 1901 Winchester created the new .32 Winchester Special caliber with production of rifles
                    starting in 1902. <br>
                    The 1894 was produced by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company through 1980 and then by U.S.
                    Repeating Arms under the Winchester brand until they ceased manufacturing rifles in 2006.
                    Reproductions are being made by the Miroku company of Japan and imported into the United States by
                    the Browning Arms company of Morgan, Utah. <br>
                    The Model 1894 has been referred to as the "ultimate lever-action design" by firearms historians
                    such as R. L. Wilson and Hal Herring. The Model 1894 is the rifle credited with the name
                    "Winchester" being used to refer to all rifles of this type and was the first commercial sporting
                    rifle to sell over 7,000,000 units.

                    One Model 1894 is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the Arms & Armor department.
                </p><br>

                <h2>OVERVIEW</h2><br>
                <p>The Winchester Model 1894 was the first commercial American repeating rifle built to be used with
                    smokeless powder. The 1894 was originally chambered to fire 2 metallic black powder cartridges, the
                    .32-40 Winchester and .38-55 Winchester. In 1895 Winchester went to a different steel composition
                    for rifle manufacturing that could handle higher pressure rounds and offered the rifle in .25-35
                    Winchester and .30-30 Winchester. The .30-30 Winchester, or .30 WCF (Winchester Centerfire), is the
                    cartridge that has become synonymous with the Model 1894. Starting in 1899, the Model 1894 was also
                    chambered in .32 Winchester Special. <br>
                    The Model 94's combination of potent firepower in a compact, lightweight, comfortable-to-carry, and
                    quick-shooting package has made it an extremely popular hunting rifle, particularly for white-tailed
                    deer in the dense forests of the Eastern United States, where most game is killed at relatively
                    short distances. As a result, it was the first sporting rifle to sell over 7,000,000 units. The
                    millionth Model 1894 was given to President Calvin Coolidge in 1927, the 1½ millionth rifle to
                    President Harry S. Truman on May 8, 1948 and the two millionth unit was given to President Dwight D.
                    Eisenhower in 1953.
                    The United States government purchased 1,800 commercial Model 1894s with 50,000 .30-30 cartridges
                    during World War I. These rifles in the 835800 to 852500 serial number range were marked atop the
                    receiver ring with a flaming bomb and "U.S." The rifles were intended for United States Army Signal
                    Corps personnel stationed in the Pacific Northwest to prevent labor strike actions from interrupting
                    manufacture of Sitka spruce lumber for framing the fuselage and wings of military aircraft. The
                    rifles were sold as military surplus after the war. To release Lee–Enfield rifles for infantry use,
                    the Royal Navy purchased approximately 5,000 .30-30 caliber Model 94 rifles in 1914 for shipboard
                    guard duty and mine-clearing. France purchased 15,100 Model 1894 carbines equipped with sling
                    swivels on the left side of the buttstock and barrel band, and with metric gradations on the No. 44A
                    rear sight. These French carbines were issued to motorcycle couriers, artillery troops, trench
                    railway personnel, and some balloon units. Some of these rifles acquired Belgian proofmarks when
                    sold as surplus through Belgium. Examples captured from the United Kingdom by the Wehrmacht were
                    designated the Gewehr 248(e).
                    The Winchester 1894 was used again in World War II in the hands of the Canadian Pacific Coast
                    Rangers who were issued them to defend the west coast of Canada from Japanese invaders. Winchester
                    '94s were also provided to the British Home Guard in the early years of WWII. The Model 94 over its
                    long history included the Winchester Model 55, produced from 1924 through 1932 in a 24-inch (610 mm)
                    barrel, and the Winchester Model 64, produced from 1933 through 1957 in 20, 24, and 26-inch (660 mm)
                    barrel lengths. From 1964 through 1980, a version of the Model 94 carbine was also sold by Sears as
                    the Ted Williams Model 100, as part of Sears' marketing arrangement with both Winchester and the
                    retired baseball star.

                <h2>DESIGN DETAILS</h2><br>
                <p>Three major changes have been made in the design and construction of the Winchester 1894 since World
                    War II, all tied to major shifts in Winchester's corporate leadership and direction. The first and
                    largest came in 1964, after the 1963 resignation of gun enthusiast John M. Olin from the presidency
                    of the company he founded, Olin Corporation. The second came in 1982, after Olin's 1981 sale of the
                    Winchester factory to its employees, who formed the U.S. Repeating Arms Company (USRAC). The third
                    in 1992, after the 1989 bankruptcy of USRAC and its subsequent purchase by FN Herstal, which sought
                    to market Winchester guns worldwide.</p><br>

                <h3>1964</h3><br>
                <p>Upon Olin's retirement, Olin Corporation's new chief executives sought to maximize company
                    profitability, giving corporate preference to its flourishing chemical business over gun production,
                    which was unprofitable and labor-intensive. As a result, Winchester ceased machining both the
                    receiver and many small parts of the Model 94 out of solid steel billet as of 1964. Sintered steel
                    was used on the receiver, stamped sheet metal for the cartridge lifter, and hollow rather than solid
                    steel roll pins used in the action. While the rifle's function, safety, and accuracy were not
                    adversely affected, the changes—in particular the sintered receiver, which was as strong as its
                    solid-steel predecessor but which did not respond well to a traditional blued finish—were
                    conspicuous and came as Winchester made even more fundamental changes to its flagship Model 70
                    bolt-action rifle. Taken together, they were seen as a retreat from quality production across the
                    company's whole range, seriously damaging Winchester's reputation for making quality firearms in the
                    process. In response, many sought out rifles made before 1964, which command a markedly higher
                    resale value on the gun market to this day.</p><br>

                <h3>1982</h3> <br>
                <p>One of the drawbacks of the original Model 1894 action in relation to competitors like the Marlin
                    Model 336 was that the Winchester ejects cartridges from the top of the receiver and over the user's
                    shoulder, rather than to the side. A top-ejecting firearm cannot mount a telescopic scope on top of
                    the receiver—the most convenient location for the shooter—without interfering with cartridge
                    ejection. A scope for such a firearm must instead be mounted either far forward on the barrel (where
                    it must be specifically designed for the purpose), or offset to the side of the gun (which creates
                    problems due to parallax). Both options seriously degrade the usefulness of a scope for such a
                    rifle. <br>
                    This was not a major concern when the gun was originally designed; the most common upgrade to guns
                    of the pre–World War II era was the installation of a peep sight to the rear of the receiver, which
                    maximized the accuracy potential of the factory-installed iron sights. Winchester had long had
                    mounting holes pre-drilled in the receiver of the gun to accommodate such a modification, and it was
                    by far the most common upgrade installed on the Model 94 for most of its history. Nevertheless,
                    consumer tastes changed in the years after World War II as high quality scopes became both widely
                    available and affordable. Commercial acceptance of the new scopes was likewise rapid, and by the
                    1970s the ability to use receiver-mounted scopes on hunting rifles had become expected by most gun
                    buyers. With the competition able to mount scopes on its receivers without difficulty, this
                    shortcoming was blamed for falling sales. In response, Winchester changed the design of the action
                    in 1982 to angled cartridge ejection, which ejects fired cartridges at an angle that allows the
                    rifle to function while fitted with a conventional receiver-mounted scope.
                </p><br>

                <h3>1992</h3><br>
                <p>Despite these changes, U.S. Repeating Arms did not flourish, declaring bankruptcy in 1989. It was
                    subsequently purchased by Belgian arms maker FN Herstal, which set about improving the whole
                    Winchester line, instituting modern CNC methods of production at Winchester's factory while also
                    seeking to expand the sales and marketing of Winchester rifles worldwide. This effort would
                    culminate in two major changes to the gun in 1992: the reintroducing of now-CNC-machined parts and
                    solid pins back into the action, and the elimination of the traditional half-cock safety notch on
                    the hammer in favor of a cross-bolt safety, which enabled the gun to be sold internationally. <br>
                    Though the increase in build quality was noted at the time, it was the conspicuous presence of the
                    new safety that generated the strongest opinions. It was widely reviled by American consumers and
                    gun writers alike as a "lawyer" safety, who said it detracted from the overall look, feel, and
                    operation of the rifle. FNH and Winchester responded in 2003 by moving the safety to the tang behind
                    the receiver, which largely quelled the controversy. Both the last Model 94s to leave the New Haven
                    factory before American production ceased in 2006 and the new Model 94s produced in Japan since 2010
                    by Miroku Corp. feature these tang-mounted safeties.
