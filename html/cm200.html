            <p class="last">The CheyTac Intervention is an American bolt-action sniper rifle manufactured by CheyTac
                USA, which can also be classified as an anti-materiel rifle. It is fed by a 7-round detachable
                single-stack magazine (an optional 5-round magazine is also available). It is specifically chambered in
                either .408 Chey Tac or .375 Chey Tac ammunition. CheyTac Inc. states that the system is capable of
                delivering sub-MOA accuracy at ranges of up to 2,500 yd (2,286 m). It is based on the EDM Arms

                <h2>DESIGN DETAILS</h2><br>
                <p>The CheyTac system consists of three major components: <br><br>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li>.408/.375 CheyTac ammunition</li>
                    <li>CheyTac "XTreme Long Distance™" Rifle</li>
                    <li>CheyTac Advanced Ballistic Computer</li>
                </ol>
                </p><br>
                <p>The CheyTac M200 Intervention is a manually operated, rotating bolt sniper rifle. It features a
                    Picatinny rail on the top of its receiver for mounting various optical sights.</p><br>

                <h3>Cartridge</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The M200 Intervention is chambered in either the .408 CheyTac or .375 CheyTac cartridge. CheyTac
                    specially developed the .408 CheyTac/.375 CheyTac cartridge for long-range use. The cartridge is
                    optimized for accuracy by a balance of the rotational and linear drag, which reduces yaw and
                    precession, and keeps the tip of the projectile pointed along the trajectory. The M200 Intervention
                    is fed through a detachable 7 round box magazine, an optional 5 round box magazine is also
                    available. Alternatively, cartridges can be loaded individually directly into the chamber.
                </p><br>

                <h3>BARREL</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The M200 Intervention uses a free floating heavy-fluted barrel, which can be quickly removed for
                    replacement or storage and transportation, and the shroud at the rear serves as a mount for an
                    integral folding bipod and a carrying handle.
                </p><br>

                <h3>MUZZLE DEVICES</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The M200 Intervention features the McArthur PGRS-1 muzzle brake, which can be used to reduce recoil.
                    The muzzle brake is also removable and can be replaced by an OPSINC suppressor.
                </p><br>

                <h3>BUTTSTOCK</h3> <br>
                <p>
                    The M200 Intervention has a collapsible and retractable buttstock that is adjustable for length of
                    pull and for easy storage and transportation. The buttstock also contains an integral rear monopod,
                    which is hinged, and can be folded up when not in use.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Day and low light optical sights</h3><br>
                <p>
                    There are two different day optical sights available for the M200 Intervention. The standard optical
                    sight is the Nightforce NXS 5.5-22x56 variable magnification telescopic sight with a 56 mm
                    objective. The alternative optical sight is the US Optics SN-9. The night vision system is the
                    AN/PVS-14 GEN III Pinnacle monocular, which attaches to the day optic using the Monoloc device. An
                    AN/PEQ-2 infrared laser provides additional lighting in low-light conditions. The device is attached
                    to a titanium strut.
                </p><br>

                <h3>ACCESSORIES</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The M200 Intervention comes with a portable advanced ballistic computer, laser rangefinder
                    binoculars and meteorological and environmental sensor package. All these components, together with
                    the sniper rifle, are part of the CheyTac Long Range Sniper System (LRSS) and are linked to the
                    ballistic computer. It provides all necessary data and calculations for accurate long range firing.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Advanced Ballistic Computer – </b>The CheyTac Advanced Ballistic Computer (ABC) System
                        software package uses tabulated bullet flight data derived from high speed Doppler radar test
                        sessions, and mathematical models to predict ballistic trajectory. It runs on Windows Mobile
                        2003 and receives input from the Kestrel handheld weather station and Vector IV laser
                        rangefinder binoculars. However, much like other ballistic prediction software, when rounds are
                        used for which no Doppler Radar-established bullet flight data is known, the ABC System relies
                        solely on mathematical ballistic models. Printed data tables are available for manual use.</li>
                    <li><b>Meteorological and environmental sensor package –</b>The KESTREL 4000 (or, 4500 NV)
                        meteorological and environmental sensor package measures the wind speed, air temperature, air
                        pressure, relative humidity, wind chill, and dew point. The KESTREL 4500 NV model is compatible
                        with night vision devices.</li>
                    <li><b>Laser rangefinder –</b>The Vector IV mil spec laser rangefinder measures distances up to
                        6,000 m (6,561.7 yd), and houses a digital compass and class 1 eye safe filters.</li>
                </ul>
                </p><br>

                <h2>VARIANTS</h2><br>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>M200 (29 in (737 mm) barrel length)</li>
                    <li>M200 Carbine (Now out of production)</li>
                    <li>M200 CIV (Civilian Variant)</li>
                    <li>M200 Rk</li>
                    <li>M310 (Single shot and repeater sub-variants all with 29 in (737 mm) barrel length)</li>
                    <li>M310 R (Repeater)</li>
                    <li>M325 (Single shot, repeater and tactical sub-variants all with 28 in (711 mm) barrel length)
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p><br>
                <p>The main capability differences between the different variants are governed by barrel length which
                    determines the obtainable muzzle velocity. Higher muzzle velocity extends the effective range of a
                    rifle, everything else being equal. The M200 and the M200 Carbine are limited to official customers
                    like military forces and come with a detachable box magazine and a telescopic stock, whilst the
                    other variants have a glass-fiber fixed McMillan A5 stock and are available for the general public.
