                <h2>AK-47</h2> <br>
                <p>The AK-47, officially known as the Avtomat Kalashnikova (Russian: Автомат Калашникова, lit.
                    'Kalashnikov's automatic [rifle]'; also known as the Kalashnikov or just AK), is a gas-operated
                    assault rifle that is chambered for the 7.62×39mm cartridge. Developed in the Soviet Union by
                    Russian small-arms designer Mikhail Kalashnikov, it is the originating firearm of the Kalashnikov
                    (or "AK") family of rifles. After more than seven decades, the AK-47 model and its variants remain
                    the most popular and widely used rifles in the world.

                    The number "47" refers to the year the rifle was finished. Design work on the AK-47 began in 1945.
                    It was presented for official military trials in 1947, and, in 1948, the fixed-stock version was
                    introduced into active service for selected units of the Soviet Army. In early 1949, the AK was
                    officially accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces and used by the majority of the member states of the
                    Warsaw Pact.

                    The model and its variants owe their global popularity to their reliability under harsh conditions,
                    low production cost (compared to contemporary weapons), availability in virtually every geographic
                    region, and ease of use. The AK has been manufactured in many countries, and has seen service with
                    armed forces as well as irregular forces and insurgencies throughout the world. As of 2004, "of the
                    estimated 500 million firearms worldwide, approximately 100 million belong to the Kalashnikov
                    family, three-quarters of which are AK-47s". The model is the basis for the development of many
                    other types of individual, crew-served and specialised firearms.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h2>HISTORY</h2> <br>
                <h3>ORIGINS</h3><br>
                <p>During World War II, the Sturmgewehr 44 rifle used by German forces made a deep impression on their
                    Soviet counterparts. The select-fire rifle was chambered for a new intermediate cartridge, the
                    7.92×33mm Kurz, and combined the firepower of a submachine gun with the range and accuracy of a
                    rifle. On 15 July 1943, an earlier model of the Sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the People's
                    Commissariat of Arms of the USSR. The Soviets were impressed with the weapon and immediately set
                    about developing an intermediate caliber fully automatic rifle of their own, to replace the PPSh-41
                    submachine guns and outdated Mosin–Nagant bolt-action rifles that armed most of the Soviet Army.

                    The Soviets soon developed the 7.62×39mm M43 cartridge, which is used in the semi-automatic SKS
                    carbine and the RPD light machine gun. Shortly after World War II, the Soviets developed the AK-47
                    rifle, which quickly replaced the SKS in Soviet service. Introduced in 1959, the AKM is a lighter
                    stamped steel version and the most ubiquitous variant of the entire AK series of firearms. In the
                    1960s, the Soviets introduced the RPK light machine gun, an AK type weapon with a stronger receiver,
                    a longer heavy barrel, and a bipod, that eventually replaced the RPD light machine gun.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>CONCEPT</h3><br>
                <p>Mikhail Kalashnikov began his career as a weapon designer in 1941 while recuperating from a shoulder
                    wound which he received during the Battle of Bryansk. Kalashnikov himself stated..."I was in the
                    hospital, and a soldier in the bed beside me asked: 'Why do our soldiers have only one rifle for two
                    or three of our men, when the Germans have automatics?' So I designed one. I was a soldier, and I
                    created a machine gun for a soldier. It was called an Avtomat Kalashnikova, the automatic weapon of
                    Kalashnikov—AK—and it carried the year of its first manufacture, 1947."

                    The AK-47 is best described as a hybrid of previous rifle technology innovations. "Kalashnikov
                    decided to design an automatic rifle combining the best features of the American M1 and the German
                    StG 44." Kalashnikov's team had access to these weapons and had no need to "reinvent the wheel".
                    Kalashnikov himself observed: "A lot of Russian Army soldiers ask me how one can become a
                    constructor, and how new weaponry is designed. These are very difficult questions. Each designer
                    seems to have his own paths, his own successes and failures. But one thing is clear: before
                    attempting to create something new, it is vital to have a good appreciation of everything that
                    already exists in this field. I myself have had many experiences confirming this to be so."

                    There are claims about Kalashnikov copying other designs, like Bulkin's TKB-415 or Simonov's AVS-31.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>REPLACEMENT</h3><br>
                <p>In 1974, the Soviets began replacing their AK-47 and AKM rifles with a newer design, the AK-74, which
                    uses 5.45×39mm ammunition. This new rifle and cartridge had only started to be manufactured in
                    Eastern European nations when the Soviet Union collapsed, drastically slowing production of the
                    AK-74 and other weapons of the former Soviet bloc.</p>
                <br><br>

                <h2>CHARACTERISTICS</h2> <br>

                <h3>SERVICE LIFE</h3> <br>

                <p>The AK-47 and its variants have been and are made in dozens of countries, with "quality ranging from
                    finely engineered weapons to pieces of questionable workmanship." As a result, the AK-47 has a
                    service/system life of approximately 6,000, to 10,000, to 15,000 rounds. The AK-47 was designed to
                    be a cheap, simple, easy to manufacture rifle, perfectly matching Soviet military doctrine that
                    treats equipment and weapons as disposable items. As units are often deployed without adequate
                    logistical support and dependent on "battlefield cannibalization" for resupply, it is actually more
                    cost-effective to replace rather than repair weapons.

                    The AK-47 has small parts and springs that need to be replaced every few thousand rounds. However,
                    "Every time it is disassembled beyond the field stripping stage, it will take some time for some
                    parts to regain their fit, some parts may tend to shake loose and fall out when firing the weapon.
                    Some parts of the AK-47 line are riveted together. Repairing these can be quite a hassle, since the
                    end of the rivet has to be ground off and a new one set after the part is replaced."</p>

                <h3>VARIANTS</h3><br>
                <h4>Early variants (7.62×39mm)</h4><br>
                <ul type="square">
                    <li>Issue of 1948/49: Type 1: The very earliest models, stamped sheet metal receiver, are now very
                        rare.</li>

                        of the MP 40 produced in Nazi Germany, for use in the restricted space in the BMP infantry
                        combat vehicle, as well as by paratroops.</li>

                        riveted sheet metal. A slanted muzzle device was added to counter climb in automatic fire. Rifle
                        weight is 3.1 kg (6.8 lb) due to the lighter receiver. This is the most ubiquitous variant of
                        the AK-47.</li>

                    </ul><br>
                    <li>RPK: Hand-held machine gun version with longer barrel and bipod. The variants—RPKS, RPKN
