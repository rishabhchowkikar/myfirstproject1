            <p class="last">The M24 Sniper Weapon System (SWS) or M24 is the military and police version of the

                The M24 SWS has the "long action" bolt version of the Remington 700 receiver but is chambered for the
                7.62×51mm NATO "short action" cartridge that has an overall length of 2.750 inches (69.85 mm). The "long
                action" allows the rifle to be re-configured for dimensionally larger cartridges up to 3.340 inches
                (84.84 mm) in overall length.

                <h2>M24 Sniper Weapon System</h2><br>
                <p>The M24 Sniper Weapon System (SWS) or M24 is the military and police version of the Remington Model
                    700 rifle, M24 being the model name assigned by the United States Army after adoption as their
                    standard sniper rifle in 1988. The M24 is referred to as a "weapon system" because it consists of
                    not only a rifle, but also a detachable telescopic sight and other accessories.
                    The M24 SWS has the "long action" bolt version of the Remington 700 receiver but is chambered for
                    the 7.62×51mm NATO "short action" cartridge that has an overall length of 2.750 inches (69.85 mm).
                    The "long action" allows the rifle to be re-configured for dimensionally larger cartridges up to
                    3.340 inches (84.84 mm) in overall length.
                    The M24 originally came tapped for the Leupold Ultra M3A 10×42mm fixed-power scope, which came with
                    a circle-shaped mil-dot glass-etched reticle. This was later replaced in 1998 by the Leupold Mk 4
                    LR/T M1 10×40mm fixed-power scope with an elongated-shaped mil-dot wire reticle.
                    The first number is the scope's magnification (10) and the second number in millimeters (40mm) is
                    the diameter of the objective lens. A fixed power scope has only one magnification (e.g., 10×) and a
                    variable power scope can be adjusted to focus between a range of magnifications (e.g., 3–9× is
                    adjustable from a minimum power of 3× to a maximum power of 9×). The rifle itself comes with a
                    detachable Harris 9–13" 1A2-LM or Harris 9–13" 1A2-L bipod unit.
                    The M24 SWS was to be replaced with the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System, a contract awarded to
                    Knight's Armament Company. However, the Army still continued to acquire M24s from Remington until
                    February 2010 and upgraded to the A2 and M24E1 standard in many cases, continuing to serve. The Army
                    chose to upgrade all its M24 rifles in the arsenals to the M2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifle, with the
                    final M24 being converted in April 2014.
                </p><br>

                <h2>Specifications</h2><br>
                <p><b>Scope:</b> Leupold Ultra M3A 10×42mm fixed power, or Leupold Mk 4 LR/T M3 10×40mm fixed power
                    scope. Detachable emergency Redfield-Palma International back-up iron sights, they are attached to
                    iron sight bases that are screwed into drilled and tapped holes machined into the front of the
                    barrel and back on the left side of the receiver. In 2001 when Remington had the second contract to
                    the U.S. military, minor changes were done to the M24. These changes included two piece Leupold Mark
                    4 scope ring bases instead of the one piece on the first series rifles, and a switch from
                    Redfield-Palma International iron sights to another manufacturer OK Weber. Redfield was out of
                    business by then, necessitating a change.</p><br>
                <p><b>Barrel:</b> Made of 416R stainless steel. The bore twist is 1-turn-in-11.25 inches [1:285.75 mm]
                    and the rifling is five radial lands and grooves (5-R) with a right-hand (RH) twist. Because of the
                    odd number of lands, none of the lands are 180° apart, i.e. in direct opposition. This results in
                    less bullet deformation, which (at least in theory) produces more consistent point of impact. In 5-R
                    rifling, the "side" of the land is cut at a 65° angle, rather than 90° in conventional rifling. This
                    results in less barrel fouling, and more consistent point of impact, compared to conventional
                    rifling when relatively high numbers of rounds are fired between cleaning, as might be expected in
                    military applications.</p><br>
                <p><b>Accuracy:</b> According to MIL-R-71126(AR), 3.15.7 Targeting and Accuracy, The rifle shall achieve
                    the dispersion set forth below when fired from a Government approved machine rest. The average mean
                    radius shall be less than or equal to the values stated below. The minimum rate of fire for
                    conducting this test shall be three rounds per minute.</p><br>
                <p><b>Stock:</b> H-S Precision PST-024, the model with the fixed cheek piece, adjustable LOP and hinged
                    floorplate. The stock secures the action via an aluminum bedding block to keep it rigid. The barrel
                    is free floating. A twin-strut extension that pulls out of the butt allows a 2-inch [50.8mm]
                    adjustment to length-of-pull, as well as allowing for the weapon to fit inside the M-1950 Weapon
                    Container for Airborne Operations. This is effected by a thick wheel on a central grooved pillar for
                    adjusting the length and a thin locking ring behind it locks the thick wheel in place. The stock is
                    primarily made from a polymer foam reinforced with fiberglass, carbon fiber, and Kevlar to reduce
                    weight and then painted with a heavy duty polane paint. They were rigorously tested before being
                    approved by Remington and the military.</p><br>

                <h2>M24 VARIANTS</h2><br>
                <h3>XM24A1</h3><br>
                <p>An experimental variant re-chambered for the .300 Winchester Magnum (7.62×67mm) round. It was not
                    adopted by the US Army due to concerns that operatives in the field would not be able to acquire the
                    special ammo. Also, the available .300 Winchester Magnum ammo that was procured sometimes misfired
                    due to incompletely-burned propellant in the longer cartridge. Redick Arms Development further
                    researched this concept, which eventually grew into the RAD M91A1 (7.62x51mm NATO) and M91A2 (.300
                    Winchester Magnum). These rifles were adopted by the US Navy SEALs.</p><br>

                <h3>M24A2</h3><br>
                <p>Remington has developed an improved version of the M24 rifle, known as the M24A2. The A2 model
                    features a detachable 5-round magazine, top-mounted and adjustable side-mounted Picatinny rails
                    (advertised by Remington as "MARS", or Modular Accessory Rail System), barrel modifications designed
                    to accommodate a sound suppressor, and an improved H-S Precision PST-026 stock with adjustable cheek
                    height and length of pull. Existing M24s can also be converted into M24A2s, which replaces the stock
                    and adds the new detachable magazine feed. The conversion requires a re-barreling of the weapon so
                    it can take the OPS silencer.</p><br>

                <h3>M24A3</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Remington developed the M24A3 SWS, a variant of the M24 chambered for the .338 Lapua Magnum round
                    (8.58×70mm) and feeding from a 5-round detachable box magazine.[15] It comes tapped for the Leupold
                    Mk 4 M1LR/T 8.5–25×50mm Variable Power day scope. It can also use detachable front and rear Back-Up
                    Iron Sights in an emergency (BUIS units are standard accessories that can be fitted to the Picatinny
                    Rail that runs on the top of the receiver and along the barrel).
                </p><br>

                <h2>Differences between M24 and M40</h2><br>
                <p>The U.S. Marine Corps also uses the Remington 700/40x action as the basis for its M40 Sniper Weapon
                    System. The primary difference between the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps rifles is that while
                    the U.S. Marine Corps M40 variants use the short-action version of the Remington 700/40x (which is
                    designed for shorter cartridges such as the .308 Winchester/7.62×51 mm NATO), the U.S. Army M24 uses
                    the Remington 700 Long Action. Despite the fact that the M24 comes fitted with a 7.62×51mm NATO
                    barrel upon issue, retaining the longer action allows them to reconfigure the rifle in dimensionally
                    larger cartridge chamberings if necessary (which has been the case during the longer engagement
                    distances during Operation Enduring Freedom). Long actions also increase reliability and reduce
                    jamming by reducing the angle of cartridges leaving the magazine and permit long, low-drag
                    heavy-for-caliber bullets to be loaded in short-action cartridges that otherwise would not fit in
                    short-action cartridges, magazines and receivers.
                    The U.S. Army reconfigured their M24 rifles to M2010 Enhanced Sniper Rifles rechambering the
                    original M24 rifles to .300 Winchester Magnum. The USMC M40A3 uses a 25 inches (635 mm) Schneider
                    barrel and the U.S. Army M24 used a 24 inches (610 mm) Rock Creek 5R barrel.
