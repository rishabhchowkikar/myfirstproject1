            <p class="last">The Accuracy International AWM (Arctic Warfare Magnum or AI-Arctic Warfare Magnum) is a
                bolt-action sniper rifle manufactured by Accuracy International designed for magnum rifle cartridges.
                The Accuracy International AWM is also unofficially known as the AWSM (Arctic Warfare Super Magnum),

                <h2>ARCTIC WARFARE MAGNUM SYSTEM</h2><br>
                <p>The Accuracy International AWM sniper rifle is a variant of the British Accuracy International Arctic
                    Warfare (AW) rifle that was the basis of a family of sniper rifles using the Arctic Warfare name. As
                    such the design details of the AWM variant are similar to the ones found in the basic AW rifle
                    system. Compared to the AW, the AWM has a longer bolt to accommodate larger magnum-length cartridges
                    such as the .300 Winchester Magnum and the .338 Lapua Magnum. The bolt head, locking ring, and
                    extractor and magazines were also revised to work with the increased size and operating pressures of
                    magnum rifle cartridges.
                    The AWM features a detachable single stack removable box magazine which holds five rounds. The
                    normal cartridges for this rifle, and the ones which have been accepted by NATO for use in AWM
                    rifles, are .300 Winchester Magnum and .338 Lapua Magnum.
                    Muzzle brakes are fitted to reduce recoil, jump and flash and act as a base for optional iron sights
                    and suppressors.

                    Standard configurations include a Schmidt & Bender PM II 5-25×56FFP MK II telescopic sight with P4F
                    graticule but variants with variable magnification of either 3–12×50 or 4–16×50 are also available.
                    Accuracy International actively promotes fitting the German made Schmidt & Bender PM II/MILITARY MK
                    II product line as sighting components on their rifles, which is rare for a rifle manufacturer. The
                    German and Russian Army prefer a telescopic sight made by Zeiss.
                    The AWM rifle is normally supplied in a metal transit case together with a telescopic sight, mount,
                    butt spacers, bipod, spare magazines, sling, cleaning and tool kits.

                <h2>MAGNUM CHAMBERINGS</h2><br>
                <h3>.300 Winchester Magnum</h3><br>
                <p>The .300 Winchester Magnum (7.62×67mm) cartridge was designed as a magnum hunting cartridge and
                    offers a flatter trajectory and a significant increase in muzzle velocity, wind resistance and
                    supersonic range over the smaller 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge. The ability of the .300 Winchester
                    Magnum chambering to obtain fairly high muzzle velocities, combined with relatively heavy and long
                    very-low-drag bullets, significantly enhance the hit probability at longer ranges and hence the
                    effective range compared to the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge. The AWM chambered for the .300 is fitted
                    with a fluted, stainless steel barrel that is 660 mm (26 in) long and features a non-traditional
                    279.4 mm (1:11 in) right-hand twist rate.
                </p><br>

                <h3>.338 Lapua Magnum</h3><br>
                <p>The AWM in the .338 Lapua Magnum (8.6×70mm) calibre was designed as a dedicated long range sniper
                    rifle. The rifle is fitted with a stainless steel, fluted, 686 mm (27.0 in) barrel, which research
                    has found to be the best compromise between muzzle velocity, weight, and length. The barrel has an
                    unconventional 279 mm (1:11 in) right-hand twist rate, optimized for firing .338-calibre
                    very-low-drag bullets up to 16.85 g (260 gr). When the AWM .338 Lapua Magnum was developed military
                    issue cartridges were loaded with 16.2 g (250 gr) very-low-drag bullets. Longer, heavier
                    very-low-drag bullets like the Sierra HPBT MatchKing .338-calibre 19.44 g (300 gr) and the 21st
                    century 19.44 gram (300 grain) .338-calibre HPBT Scenar can be used, but require a 254 mm (1:10 in)
                    twist rate to stabilize them under high air density conditions as found on arctic coasts.
                    A limitation of AWM rifles is that .338 Lapua Magnum cartridges loaded to the Commission
                    Internationale Permanente pour l'Epreuve des Armes à Feu Portatives (C.I.P.) maximum allowed overall
                    length of 93.50 mm (3.681 in) do not fit in the magazine due to a lack of internal magazine length.
                    This is because the AWM bolt action was initially developed for smaller cartridges, and then
                    modified for the .338 Lapua Magnum chambering. Ammunition manufacturers produce .338 Lapua Magnum
                    military issue cartridges loaded with 16.2 g (250 gr) very-low-drag bullets (overall length ≤ 91.44
                    mm (3.600 in)) that fit in the 91.5 mm (3.60 in) long AWM magazines. As long as .338 Lapua Magnum
                    cartridges that fit in the magazines are used, the AWM rifles can be used as repeating rifles
                    instead of single shot rifles.
                    To address .338 Lapua Magnum ammunition length limitations of the AWM, Accuracy International has
                    since developed the AX338 long range rifle as the AWM successor model. The bolt action of the AX338
                    is longer and wider than the AWM, and the internal magazine is lengthened, allowing the unimpaired
                    use of .338 Lapua Magnum cartridges loaded to the C.I.P. (Permanent International Commission for the
                    Proof of Firearms Portable) maximum allowed overall length of 93.5 mm (3.68 in). Furthermore, the
                    AX338 has a 238 mm (1:9.375 in) twist rate to adequately stabilize longer, heavier .338 caliber
                    very-low-drag projectile designs that became more common in the 21st century.

                    Ammunition types available for the .338 Lapua Magnum are FMJ, hollow point, armour piercing (AP) and
                    armour piercing incendiary (API).

                <h2>MILITARY ADOPTION</h2><br>
                <h3>German Armed Forces</h3><br>
                <p>Since 1998 the Bundeswehr fields an AWM-F chambered in .300 Winchester Magnum (7.62 × 67 mm in
                    Bundeswehr nomenclature), with a 3–12×56 SSG telescopic sight made by the German company Zeiss,
                    under the designation of G22 (for Gewehr 22) or Scharfschützengewehr 22 (sniper rifle 22). The
                    German G22 rifles have folding stocks and emergency iron sights. For their G22 rifles, the
                    Bundeswehr claims an effective range of 1,100 m (1,203 yd) and muzzle velocity of 885 m/s (2,904
                    ft/s).
                    The German ammunition manufacturer Metallwerk Elisenhütte Nassau (MEN) has specially developed 7.62
                    × 67 mm ammunition for the G22.
                    The Carl Zeiss Optronics (previously branded as Hensoldt) telescopic sight has a mil-dot reticle and
                    a scale that enables the operator to see the dialled in elevation setting through the rifle scopes
                    ocular. The Bundeswehr 3–12×56 SSG telescopic sight differs somewhat from the further developed
                    3–12×56 SSG-P telescopic sight. The Bundeswehr telescopic sight has no parallax setting option and
                    the range scale has a setting range from 0 to 10 instead of 0 to 11 symbolizing the 11.2 milliradian
                    elevation adjustment range shown in the current Carl Zeiss Optronics 3–12×56 SSG-P telescopic sight
                    brochure.
                    The G22A1 has a Schmidt & Bender 3-12×50 telescopic sight and Harris Engineering bipod and is in use
                    with German special forces.
                    The G22A2 is an upgraded variant featuring an AX series chassis stock, a new monopod and bipod, a
                    new double chamber muzzle brake and a Steiner-Optik GmbH M5Xi 5-25×56 MTC LT LPF – TreMoR3s
                    telescopic sight. The accessory pack besides spare and maintenance parts includes a Kestrel 5700
                    Elite Weather Meter with an integrated ballistic calculator. In 2019 Accuracy International was
                    awarded a contract to refurbish and upgrade all G22 and G22A1 rifles to the G22A2 standard.
