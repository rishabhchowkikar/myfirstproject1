                <h2>Karabiner 98k</h2><br>
                <p>The Karabiner 98 kurz, often abbreviated Karabiner 98k, Kar98k or K98k and also sometimes incorrectly
                    referred to as a K98 (a K98 is a Polish carbine and copy of the Kar98a), is a bolt-action rifle
                    chambered for the 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge. It was adopted on 21 June 1935 as the standard service
                    rifle by the German Wehrmacht. It was one of the final developments in the long line of Mauser
                    military rifles.

                    Although supplemented by semi-automatic and fully automatic rifles during World War II, the
                    Karabiner 98k remained the primary German service rifle until the end of the war in 1945. Millions
                    were captured by the Soviets at the conclusion of World War II and were widely distributed as
                    military aid. The Karabiner 98k therefore continues to appear in conflicts across the world as they
                    are taken out of storage during times of strife.</p><br>


                <h2>HISTORY</h2><br>
                <p>In February 1934 the Heereswaffenamt (Army Weapons Agency) ordered the adoption of a new military
                    rifle. The Karabiner 98k was derived from earlier rifles, namely the Mauser Standardmodell of 1924
                    and the Karabiner 98b, which in turn had both been developed from the Gewehr 98. Since the Karabiner
                    98k rifle was shorter than the earlier Karabiner 98b (the 98b was a carbine in name only, as it was
                    in reality a version of the Gewehr 98 long rifle designated a carbine to adhere to the Treaty of
                    Versailles; the 98b was additionally fitted with a tangent rear sight rather than the more
                    claustrophobic "Lange" ramp sight), the new rifle was given the designation Karabiner 98 kurz,
                    meaning "Carbine 98 Short". Just like its predecessor, the rifle was noted for its reliability,
                    safety and an effective range of up to 500 metres (550 yd) with iron sights and 1,000 metres (1,090
                    yd) with an 8× telescopic sight <br>
                    The desire for adopting new shorter barreled rifles and the introduction of the Karabiner 98k,
                    featuring a 600 mm (23.62 in) long barrel, were reasons for changing the standard German service
                    ball rifle cartridge. The 1903 pattern 7.92×57mm Mauser S Patrone produced excessive muzzle flash
                    when fired from arms that did not have a long barrel like the Gewehr 98. It was found that the s.S.
                    Patrone, originally designed for long range machine gun use, produced less muzzle flash out of
                    rifles that had a shorter barrel and also provided better accuracy. Because of this the S Patrone
                    was phased out in 1933 and the s.S. Patrone became the standard German service ball cartridge in the
                    1930s.
                </p><br>

                <h2>DESIGN DETAILS</h2><br>
                <h3>FEATURES</h3><br>
                <p>The Karabiner 98k is a controlled-feed bolt-action rifle based on the Mauser M98 system. Its internal
                    magazine can be loaded with five 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridges from a stripper clip or one-by-one.
                    After loading, the empty clip is ejected when the bolt is closed. The straight bolt handle found on
                    the Gewehr 98 bolt was replaced by a turned-down bolt handle on the Karabiner 98k. This change made
                    it easier to rapidly operate the bolt, reduced the amount the handle projected beyond the receiver,
                    and enabled mounting of aiming optics directly above the receiver. Each rifle was furnished with a
                    short length of cleaning rod, fitted through the bayonet stud. The joined rods from 3 rifles
                    provided one full-length cleaning rod.
                    The metal parts of the rifle were blued, a process in which steel is partially protected against
                    rust by a layer of magnetite (Fe3O4). Such a thin black oxide layer provides only minimal protection
                    against rust or corrosion, unless also treated with a water-displacing oil to reduce wetting and
                    galvanic corrosion. From 1944 onwards phosphating/Parkerizing was introduced as a more effective
                    metal surface treatment.
                </p><br>

                <h3>STOCK</h3><br>
                <p>Early Karabiner 98k rifles had solid one-piece stocks. From 1937 onwards the rifles had laminated
                    stocks, the result of trials that had stretched through the 1930s. Plywood laminates are stronger
                    and resisted warping better than the conventional one-piece patterns, did not require lengthy
                    maturing, and were cheaper. The laminated stocks were, due to their dense composite structure,
                    somewhat heavier compared to one-piece stocks. In addition to the use of walnut and beech laminate,
                    elm was used in small quantities. The butts of the semi-pistol grip Karabiner 98k stocks were not
                    uniform. Until early 1940 the stocks had a flat buttplate. After 1940 some stocks had a cupped
                    buttplate to prevent the separation of the butt stock. All stocks had a steel buttplate.

                </p><br>

                <h3>ACCESSORIES</h3><br>
                <p>When issued the Karabiner 98k came accompanied with assorted accessory items including a sling, a
                    protective muzzle cover, and for field maintenance a Reinigungsgerät 34 ("Cleaning Kit 34") or RG34
                    kit. Introduced in 1934, the Reinigungsgerät 34 consisted of a flat 85 mm (3.3 in) wide by 135 mm
                    (5.3 in) long sheet metal container with two hinged lids carried on the person, which held an oiler,
                    a take down tool for removing the floorplate and cleaning the receiver of the rifle, an aluminum
                    barrel pull-through chain, a cleaning and an oiling brush, and short lengths of tow used as cleaning
                    patches. From 1905 until 1945 the German military used Ballistol intended for cleaning, lubricating,
                    and protecting metallic, wooden and leather firearms parts
                    The Karabiner 98k rifle was designed to be used with an S84/98 III bayonet. The S84/98 III had a
                    blade length of 252 mm (9.9 in) and an overall length of 385 mm (15.2 in) and was accompanied by a
                    bayonet frog. The Seitengewehr 42 or SG 42 was a shorter multi tool combat knife that could also be
                    mounted as a bayonet on the Karabiner 98k rifle. The SG 42 was issued in small numbers.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Rifle Grenade Launcher</h3><br>
                <p>Starting from 1941, the short 1.5× Zielfernrohr 41 (ZF41) long eye relief telescopic sight was fitted
                    over the rear iron sight element to some Karabiner 98k rifles for designated marksman use. Adding
                    the ZF41 to the rifle turned the Karabiner 98k essentially into an early somewhat big and heavy
                    scout rifle, though that concept did not exist at that time. The ZF41 was in fact the first attempt
                    to provide the ordinary infantryman with a rifle capable of being used for sharpshooting. Early
                    production ZF41 were matched, zeroed and fitted on Karabiner 98k rifles selected for being
                    exceptionally accurate at the factory before issue. After the development of a field replaceable
                    mount the ZF41 sights were issued to be mounted on random Karabiner 98k rifles by field armorers.
                    This led to an inevitable reduction in accuracy in lots of these field fitted rifles. By the end of
                    the war in 1945, more than 100,000 Zf41 sights had been produced, the largest production of German
                    optical sights during the war.

                </p><br>

                <h3>SUPPRESSORS</h3><br>

                <p>A removable, muzzle-mounted HUB-23 suppressor, visually resembling the Schießbecher, was manufactured
                    for the Karabiner 98k. After several suppressor proposals from the firearms industry and the
                    SS-Waffenakademie (SS Weapons Academy) the HUB-23 was produced based on a design proposal by
                    Unteroffizier Schätzle. The HUB-23 weighs 0.5 kg (1.1 lb) and is 180 mm (7.1 in) long. The maximum
                    effective range of a Karbiner 98k with a HUB-23 mounted and firing special subsonic Nahpatrone
                    ("near cartridge") reduced load ammunition with a muzzle velocity of 220 m/s (722 ft/s) was 300 m
                    (330 yd). The use of the HUB-23 suppressor and subsonic ammunition resulted in a sound signature
                    reduction by 75%. The HUB-23 suppressor and the special subsonic ammunition were mainly used by
                    special forces units such as the Brandenburgers and snipers.</p><br>

                <h2>VARIANTS</h2><br>
                <h3>Kriegsmodell</h3>
                <p>Starting in late 1944, Karabiner 98k production began transition to the Kriegsmodell ("war model")
                    variant. This version was simplified to increase the rate of production, removing the bayonet lug,
                    cleaning rod, stock disc (which functions as a bolt disassembly tool), and other features deemed
                    unnecessary. Non-critical parts like the stock were finished to lower standards and metal parts like
                    the nose cap, barrel band, floor plate and trigger guard (lacking the small locking screw provision)
                    were simplified stamped parts and less elaborately mounted to the rifle. The M98 bolt was also
                    simplified by no longer milling the two oval-shaped emergency gas relief holes in the bottom of the
                    bolt. Instead, two emergency gas relief holes were drilled and the bolt guide was omitted from the
                    bolt body. It had fewer serial numbered parts, a phosphate metal surface finish, and a hole at the
                    bottom end of the butt plate that replaced the stock disk. At least two transitional variants
                    existed, which incorporated only some Kriegsmodell features, and some factories never switched to
                    Kriegsmodell production at all.</p><br>


                <h3>Sniper Variant</h3><br>
                <p>
                    For snipers, Karabiner 98k rifles selected for being exceptionally accurate during factory tests
                    were fitted with a telescopic sight as sniper rifles. Karabiner 98k sniper rifles had an effective
                    range of up to 1,000 m (1,094 yd) when used by a skilled sniper. The German Zeiss Zielvier 4× (ZF39)
                    telescopic sight had bullet drop compensation in 50 m (55 yd) increments for ranges from 100 to 800
                    m (109 to 875 yd) or in some variations from 100 to 1,000 m (109 to 1,094 yd). There were also Zeiss
                    Zielsechs 6× and Zielacht 8× telescopic sights and sights by various other manufacturers like the
                    Ajack 4× and 6×, Hensoldt Dialytan 4×, Kahles Heliavier 4× and Opticotechna Dialytan 4× with similar
                    features employed on Karabiner 98k sniper rifles. Several different mountings produced by various
                    manufacturers were used. The Karabiner 98k was not designed to accept telescopic sights. Attaching
                    such sights to a Karabiner 98k required machining by a skilled armourer. A telescopic sight mounted
                    low above the center axis of the receiver will not leave enough space between the rifle and the
                    telescopic sight body for unimpaired operation of the bolt handle or the three-position safety catch
                    lever. This ergonomic problem was solved by mounting the telescopic sight relatively high above the
                    receiver and sometimes modifying or replacing the safety operating lever or using an offset mounting
                    to position the telescopic sight axis to the left side in relation to the receiver center axis. A
                    common minor modification was replacing the stock buttplate with a waffled anti-slip "sniper"
                    buttplate. Approximately 132,000 of these sniper rifles were produced by Germany.

                <h3>Paratrooper Variants</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Experimental versions of the Karabiner 98k intended for the German paratroopers that could be
                    transported in shortened modes were produced. The standard Karabiner 98k was too long to be carried
                    in a parachute drop. However, the German paratroopers made only limited combat drops after the 1941
                    Battle of Crete; there was therefore little need for these rifles. Specimens with folding stocks
                    (Klappschaft) and with detachable barrels (Abnehmbarer Lauf) are known to have been produced at
                    Mauser Oberndorf.

                <h3>G40k</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The G40k with a total length of 1,000 mm (39.37 in) and a barrel length of 490 mm (19.29 in) and 3.2
                    kg (7.1 lb) weight was a shortened experimental version of the Karabiner 98k. The rear tangent sight
                    of the G40k was graduated for s.S. Patrone cartridges from 100 m to 1000 m in 100 m increments. A
                    batch of 82 G40k rifles was produced in 1941 at Mauser Oberndorf.

                <h3>Mauser KKW Cadet Rifle</h3><br>
                <p>
                    The Mauser KKW cadet rifle is a single shot, .22 caliber rifle that was introduced in 1938. Its
                    operation is virtually identical to the Karabiner 98k. These cadet rifles were used by all German
                    military, paramilitary and police organizations, especially the Hitler Youth.
