            <p class="last">The 3-line rifle M1891, colloquially (but mistakenly; see Nagant's legal dispute) known in
                the West as Mosin–Nagant and in Russia and former Soviet Union as Mosin's rifle (Russian: винтовка
                Мосина, ISO 9: vintovka Mosina), is a five-shot, bolt-action, internal magazine–fed military rifle. It
                is primarily found chambered for its original 7.62×54mmR cartridge.
                Developed from 1882 to 1891, it was used by the armed forces of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and
                various other nations. It is one of the most mass-produced military bolt-action rifles in history with
                over 37 million units having been made since 1891. In spite of its age, it has been used in various
                conflicts around the world up to the present day.

                <h2>HSITORY</h2><br>
                <h3>Initial design and tests</h3><br>
                <p>During the Russo-Ottoman War of 1877–1878, Russian troops armed mostly with Berdan single-shot rifles
                    suffered heavy casualties against Turkish troops equipped with Winchester repeating rifles,
                    particularly at the bloody Siege of Pleven. This showed Russian commanders the need to modernize the
                    general infantry weapon of the army. <br>
                    Various weapons were acquired and tested by GAU of the Ministry of Defense of Russian Empire, and in
                    1889 the Lebel M1886 was obtained through semi-official channels from France. It was supplied
                    together with a model of the cartridge and bullet but without the primer and the smokeless powder.
                    Those problems were solved by Russian scientists and engineers (the smokeless powder, for instance,
                    was produced by Dmitri Mendeleev himself). <br>

                    In 1889, three rifles were submitted for evaluation: Captain Sergei Ivanovich Mosin of the imperial
                    army submitted his "3-line" caliber (.30 cal, 7.62 mm) rifle; Belgian designer Léon Nagant submitted
                    a "3.5-line" (.35 caliber, 9 mm) design; and a Captain Zinoviev submitted another "3-line" design (1
                    "line" = 1⁄10 in or 2.54 mm, thus 3 lines = 7.62 mm). <br>
                    When trials concluded in 1891, the evaluators were split in their assessment. The main disadvantages
                    of Mosin's rifle were a more complicated mechanism and a long and tiresome procedure of
                    disassembling (which required special instruments—it was necessary to unscrew two fasteners).
                    Nagant's rifle was mainly criticized for its lower quality of manufacture and materials, due to
                    "artisan pre-production" of his 300 rifles. The commission initially voted 14 to 10 to approve
                    Mosin's rifle. At this point the decision was made to rename the existing commission and call it
                    Commission for creation of the small-bore rifle (Комиссия для выработки образца малокалиберного
                    ружья), and to put on paper the final requirements for such a rifle. The inventors obliged by
                    delivering their final designs. Head of the commission, General Chagin, ordered subsequent tests
                    held under the commission's supervision, after which the bolt-action of Mosin's design was ordered
                    into production under the name of 3-line rifle M1891
                </p><br>

                <h3>Technical detail</h3><br>
                <p>Like the Gewehr 98, the 1891 Mosin uses two front-locking lugs to lock up the action. However, the
                    Mosin's lugs lock in the horizontal position, whereas the Mauser locks vertically. The Mosin bolt
                    body is multi-piece whereas the Mauser is one piece. The Mosin uses interchangeable bolt heads like
                    the Lee–Enfield. Unlike the Mauser, which uses a controlled feed bolt head in which the cartridge
                    base snaps up under the fixed extractor as the cartridge is fed from the magazine, the Mosin has a
                    push feed recessed bolt head in which the spring-loaded extractor snaps over the cartridge base as
                    the bolt is finally closed similar to the Gewehr 1888 and M91 Carcano or modern sporting rifles like
                    the Remington 700. Like the Mauser, the Mosin uses a blade ejector mounted in the receiver. The
                    Mosin bolt is removed by simply pulling it fully to the rear of the receiver and squeezing the
                    trigger, while the Mauser has a bolt stop lever separate from the trigger. <br>
                    Like the Mauser, the bolt lift arc on the Mosin–Nagant is 90 degrees, versus 60 degrees on the
                    Lee–Enfield. The Mauser bolt handle is at the rear of the bolt body and locks behind the solid rear
                    receiver ring. The Mosin bolt handle is similar to the Mannlicher: it is attached to a protrusion on
                    the middle of the bolt body, which serves as a bolt guide, and it locks protruding out of the
                    ejection/loading port in front of a split rear receiver ring, also serving a similar function to
                    Mauser's "third" or " safety" lug. <br>

                    The rifling of the Mosin barrel is right turning (clockwise looking down the rifle) 4-groove with a
                    twist of 1:9.5" or 1:10". The 5-round fixed metallic magazine can either be loaded by inserting the
                    cartridges individually, or more often in military service, by the use of 5-round stripper clips.
                    <br>
                </p> <br>

                <h3>Refinement and Production</h3><br>
                <p> The 3-line rifle, Model 1891, its original official designation, was adopted by the Russian military
                    in 1891. There have been several variations from the original rifle, the most common being the
                    M1891/30 (commonly referred to as "the 91/30" by shooters), which was a modernized design introduced
                    in 1930. Some details were borrowed from Nagant's design. One such detail is the attachment of the
                    magazine spring to the magazine base plate. In Mosin's original design the spring was not attached
                    to the base plate and, according to the Commission, could be lost during cleaning. Another detail is
                    the form of the clip that could hold five cartridges to be loaded simultaneously into the magazine.
                    <br>
                    Another detail is the form of the interrupter, a specially designed part within the receiver, which
                    helps prevent double feeding. The initial rifle proposed by Mosin lacked an interrupter, leading to
                    numerous failures to feed. This detail was introduced in the rifle borrowing from Nagant's rifle.
                    Although the form of the interrupter was slightly changed, this alteration was subsequently borrowed
                    back by the Commission for the Model 1891 Mosin–Nagant. During the modernization of 1930, the form
                    of the interrupter was further changed, from a single piece to a two-piece design, as the part had
                    turned out to be one of the least reliable parts of the action. Only the clip for loading cartridges
                    and the attachment of the magazine spring to the magazine base plate in subsequent models were
                    designed by Nagant. Considering the rifle could be easily loaded without using a clip, one cartridge
                    after another, the magazine spring attached to the magazine base plate is the only contribution of
                    Nagant to all rifles after 1930. <br>

                </p><br>

                <h3>Nagant's Legal Dispute</h3><br>
                <p>
                    Despite the failure of Nagant's rifle, he filed a patent suit, claiming he was entitled to the sum
                    the winner was to receive. It appeared that Nagant was the first to apply for the international
                    patent protection over the interrupter, although he borrowed it from Mosin's design initially. Mosin
                    could not apply for a patent since he was an officer of the Russian army, and the design of the
                    rifle was owned by the Government and had the status of a military secret. <br>
                    A scandal was about to burst out, with Nagant threatening he would not participate in trials held in
                    Russia ever again and some officials proposing to expel Nagant from any further trials, as he
                    borrowed the design of the interrupter after it was covered by the secrecy status given in Russia of
                    that time to military inventions and therefore violated Russian law. Taking into consideration that
                    Nagant was one of the few producers not engaged by competitive governments and generally eager to
                    cooperate and share experience and technology, the Commission paid him a sum of 200,000 Russian
                    rubles, equal to the premium that Mosin received as the winner. The rifle did not receive the name
                    of Mosin, because of the personal decision taken by Tsar Alexander III, which was made based on the
                    opinion of the Defence Minister Pyotr Vannovskiy: there are parts in this newly created design,
                    invented by Colonel Rogovtzev, by Lt.-General Chagin's Commission, Captain Mosin and small-arms
                    manufacturer Nagant, therefore it is only fair to call it Russian 3-line rifle M1891.[6] The Tsar
                    himself dashed the word "Russian" from this document with his own hand. This turned out to be a wise
                    decision, as Leon Nagant remained the major contractor for the Russian Government, and in 1895,
                    Nagant's revolver was adopted by the Russian army as the main sidearm. <br>
                    However, for the same reason and because of Nagant's attempts to use the situation for publicity,
                    the "Mosin–Nagant" name appeared in the Western literature (the rifle was never called this in
                    Russia or the USSR). The name is a misnomer from the legal point of view (taking into consideration
                    the legal provisions of Russian law at that time, i.e. the law of the country to adopt the rifle)
                    and from technical point of view, as none of the details borrowed from Nagant's design, even if
                    removed, would prevent the rifle from firing. Moreover, from the technical point of view the rifle
                    that came to be called "Mosin–Nagant" (or "Nagant–Mosin") is the design proposed by Mosin, as
                    further amended by Mosin with some details being borrowed from Nagant's design. Only since 1924 the
                    rifle was officially named the "Mosin's rifle" in the USSR, although peculiar models were still
                    designated by a year only.
                    Production of the Model 1891 began in 1892 at the ordnance factories of Tula Arsenal, Izhevsk
                    Arsenal and at Sestroryetsk Arsenal. An order for 500,000 rifles was placed with the French arms
                    factory, Manufacture Nationale d'Armes de Châtellerault.

                <h3>World War I</h3><br>
                <p>With the start of World War I, production was restricted to the M1891 dragoon and infantry models for
                    the sake of simplicity. Due to the desperate shortage of arms and the shortcomings of a
                    still-developing domestic industry, the Russian government ordered 1.5 million M1891 infantry rifles
                    from Remington Arms and another 1.8 million from New England Westinghouse Company in the United
                    States in 1915. Remington produced 750,000 rifles before production was halted by the 1917 October
                    Revolution. Deliveries to Russia had amounted to 469,951 rifles when the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk
                    ended hostilities between the Central Powers and now Soviet-Russia. Henceforth, the new Bolshevik
                    government of Vladimir Lenin cancelled payments to the American companies manufacturing the
                    Mosin–Nagant (Russia had not paid for the order at any time throughout the Great War).
                    With Remington and Westinghouse on the precipice of bankruptcy from the Communists' decision, the
                    remaining 280,000 rifles were purchased by the United States Army. American and British
                    expeditionary forces of the North Russia Campaign were armed with these rifles and sent to Murmansk
                    and Arkhangelsk in the late summer of 1918 to prevent the large quantities of munitions delivered
                    for Czarist forces from being captured by the Central Powers. Remaining rifles were used for the
                    training of U.S. Army troops. Some were used to equip U.S. National Guard, SATC, and ROTC units.
                    Designated "U.S. Rifle, 7.62mm, Model of 1916", these are among the rarest of American service arms.
                    In 1917, 50,000 rifles were sent via Vladivostok to the Czechoslovak Legions in Siberia to aid in
                    their attempt to secure passage to France.
                    Many of the New England Westinghouse and Remington Mosin–Nagants were sold to private citizens in
                    the United States before World War II through the office of the Director of Civilian Marksmanship,
                    the predecessor to the federal government's current Civilian Marksmanship Program.

                    Large numbers of Mosin–Nagants were captured by German and Austro-Hungarian forces and saw service
                    with the rear-echelon forces of both armies, and also with the Imperial German Navy. Many of these
                    weapons were sold to Finland in the 1920s.

                <h3>World War II</h3><br>
                <p>
                    At the beginning of the war, the Mosin–Nagant 91/30 was the standard issue weapon of Soviet troops
                    and millions of the rifles were produced and used in World War II by the largest mobilized army in
                    history. <br>

                    The Mosin–Nagant Model 1891/30 was modified and adapted as a sniper rifle from 1932 onwards with
                    mounts and scopes from Germany at first and subsequently with domestic designs (PE, PEM) and from
                    1942 was issued with 3.5-power PU fixed focus scopes to Soviet snipers. It served quite prominently
                    in the brutal urban battles on the Eastern Front, such as the Battle of Stalingrad, which made
                    heroes of snipers like Vasily Zaitsev, Lyudmila Pavlichenko, Ivan Sidorenko, and Roza Shanina.
                    Finland also employed the Mosin–Nagant as a sniper rifle, with similar success with their own
                    designs and captured Soviet rifles. For example, Simo Häyhä is credited with having killed 505
                    Soviet soldiers, many of whom fell victim to his Finnish M/28-30 Mosin–Nagant rifle. Häyhä did not
                    use a scope on his Mosin. In interviews Häyhä gave before his death, he said that the scope and
                    mount designed by the Soviets required the shooter to expose himself too much and raise his head too
                    high, increasing the chances of being spotted by the enemy. In addition, scopes tended to reflect
                    sunlight when moved side to side, which gave away a sniper's position. <br>
                    In 1935–1936, the 91/30 was again modified, this time to lower production time. The "hex" receiver
                    was changed to a round receiver. When war with Germany broke out, the need to produce Mosin–Nagants
                    in vast quantities led to a further simplification of machining and a falling-off in finish of the
                    rifles. The wartime Mosins are easily identified by the presence of tool marks and rough finishing
                    that never would have passed the inspectors in peacetime. However, despite a lack of both aesthetic
                    focus and uniformity, the basic functionality of the Mosins was unimpaired. <br>
                    In addition, in 1938, a carbine version of the Mosin–Nagant, the M38, was issued. The carbine used
                    the same cartridge and action as other Mosins, but the barrel was shortened by 21.6 cm (8.5 in) to
                    bring the weapon down to an overall length of 101.6 cm (40.0 in), with the forearm shortened in
                    proportion. The idea was to issue the M38 to troops such as combat engineers, signal corps, and
                    artillerymen, who could conceivably need to defend themselves from sudden enemy advances, but whose
                    primary duties lay behind the front lines. Significantly, the front sight of the M38 was positioned
                    in such a way that the Model 91/30's cruciform bayonet could not be mounted to the muzzle even if a
                    soldier obtained one <br>
                    An increase in urban combat led directly to the development of the Model M44 Mosin. In essence, the
                    M44 is an M38 with a slightly modified forearm and with a permanently mounted cruciform bayonet that
                    folds to the right when it is not needed. In terms of handiness, the M44 was an improvement on the
                    Model 91/30, particularly for urban warfare; but few M44s saw combat on the Eastern Front.

                    By the end of the war, approximately 19.8 million rifles had been produced.
