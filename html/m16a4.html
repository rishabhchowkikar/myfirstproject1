                <h2>M16 Rifle</h2> <br>
                <p>The M16 rifle (officially designated Rifle, Caliber 5.56 mm, M16) is a family of military rifles
                    adapted from the ArmaLite AR-15 rifle for the United States military. The original M16 rifle was a
                    5.56×45mm automatic rifle with a 20-round magazine.

                    In 1964, the M16 entered US military service and the following year was deployed for jungle warfare
                    operations during the Vietnam War. In 1969, the M16A1 replaced the M14 rifle to become the US
                    military's standard service rifle. The M16A1's modifications include a bolt-assist, chrome-plated
                    bore and a 30-round magazine.

                    In 1983, the US Marine Corps adopted the M16A2 rifle and the US Army adopted it in 1986. The M16A2
                    fires the improved 5.56×45mm (M855/SS109) cartridge and has a newer adjustable rear sight, case
                    deflector, heavy barrel, improved handguard, pistol grip and buttstock, as well as a semi-auto and
                    three-round burst fire selector. Adopted in July 1997, the M16A4 is the fourth generation of the M16
                    series. It is equipped with a removable carrying handle and Picatinny rail for mounting optics and
                    other ancillary devices.

                    The M16 has also been widely adopted by other armed forces around the world. Total worldwide
                    production of M16s is approximately 8 million, making it the most-produced firearm of its 5.56 mm
                    caliber. The US military has largely replaced the M16 in frontline combat units with a shorter and
                    lighter version, the M4 carbine.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h2>HISTORY</h2><br>
                <h3>BACKGROUND</h3><br>
                <p>In 1928, a U.S. Army 'Caliber Board' conducted firing tests at Aberdeen Proving Ground and
                    recommended transitioning to smaller caliber rounds, mentioning in particular .27 in (6.86 mm)
                    caliber. Largely in deference to tradition, this recommendation was ignored and the Army referred to
                    the .30 in (7.62 mm) caliber as "full sized" for the next 35 years. After World War II, the United
                    States military started looking for a single automatic rifle to replace the M1 Garand, M1/M2
                    Carbines, M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle, M3 "Grease Gun" and Thompson submachine gun. However,
                    early experiments with select-fire versions of the M1 Garand proved disappointing. During the Korean
                    War, the select-fire M2 carbine largely replaced the submachine gun in US service and became the
                    most widely used carbine variant. However, combat experience suggested that the .30 Carbine round
                    was underpowered. American weapons designers concluded that an intermediate round was necessary, and
                    recommended a small-caliber, high-velocity cartridge.

                    However, senior American commanders, having faced fanatical enemies and experienced major logistical
                    problems during World War II and the Korean War, insisted that a single, powerful .30 caliber
                    cartridge be developed, that could not only be used by the new automatic rifle, but by the new
                    general-purpose machine gun (GPMG) in concurrent development. This culminated in the development of
                    the 7.62×51 mm NATO cartridge.

                    The U.S. Army then began testing several rifles to replace the obsolete M1. Springfield Armory's
                    T44E4 and heavier T44E5 were essentially updated versions of the M1 chambered for the new 7.62 mm
                    round, while Fabrique Nationale submitted their FN FAL as the T48. ArmaLite entered the competition
                    late, hurriedly submitting several AR-10 prototype rifles in the fall of 1956 to the U.S. Army's
                    Springfield Armory for testing. The AR-10 featured an innovative straight-line barrel/stock design,
                    forged aluminum alloy receivers and with phenolic composite stocks. It had rugged elevated sights,
                    an oversized aluminum flash suppressor and recoil compensator, and an adjustable gas system. The
                    final prototype featured an upper and lower receiver with the now-familiar hinge and takedown pins,
                    and the charging handle was on top of the receiver placed inside of the carry handle. For a 7.62 mm
                    NATO rifle, the AR-10 was incredibly lightweight at only 6.85 lb (3.11 kg) empty. Initial comments
                    by Springfield Armory test staff were favorable, and some testers commented that the AR-10 was the
                    best lightweight automatic rifle ever tested by the Armory. In the end the U.S. Army chose the T44,
                    now named M14 rifle, which was an improved M1 Garand with a 20-round magazine and automatic fire
                    capability. The U.S. also adopted the M60 general purpose machine gun (GPMG). Its NATO partners
                    adopted the FN FAL and HK G3 rifles, as well as the FN MAG and Rheinmetall MG3 GPMGs.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>ADOPTION</h3><br>
                <p>In July 1960, General Curtis LeMay was impressed by a demonstration of the ArmaLite AR-15. In the
                    summer of 1961, General LeMay was promoted to U.S. Air Force chief of staff, and requested 80,000
                    AR-15s. However, General Maxwell D. Taylor, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, advised President
                    John F. Kennedy that having two different calibers within the military system at the same time would
                    be problematic and the request was rejected. In October 1961, William Godel, a senior man at the
                    Advanced Research Projects Agency, sent 10 AR-15s to South Vietnam. The reception was enthusiastic,
                    and in 1962 another 1,000 AR-15s were sent. United States Army Special Forces personnel filed
                    battlefield reports lavishly praising the AR-15 and the stopping-power of the 5.56 mm cartridge, and
                    pressed for its adoption.

                    The damage caused by the 5.56 mm bullet was originally believed to be caused by "tumbling" due to
                    the slow 1 turn in 14-inch (360 mm) rifling twist rate. However, any pointed lead core bullet will
                    "tumble" after penetration in flesh, because the center of gravity is towards the rear of the
                    bullet. The large wounds observed by soldiers in Vietnam were actually caused by bullet
                    fragmentation created by a combination of the bullet's velocity and construction. These wounds were
                    so devastating, that the photographs remained classified into the 1980s.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h2>VARIANTS</h2><br>

                <h3>M16</h3><br>
                <p>This was the first M16 variant adopted operationally, originally by the U.S. Air Force. It was
                    equipped with triangular handguards, buttstocks without a compartment for the storage of a cleaning
                    kit, a three-pronged "duckbill" flash suppressor designed to preserve the shooter's night vision by
                    disrupting the flash, full auto, and no forward assist. The M16 has a safe/semi/auto selective fire
                    trigger group. Bolt carriers were originally chrome plated and slick-sided, lacking forward assist
                    notches. Later, the chrome plated carriers were dropped in favor of Army issued notched and
                    parkerized carriers though the interior portion of the bolt carrier is still chrome-lined. The
                    barrel rifling had a 1:12 (305 mm) twist rate to adequately stabilize M193 ball and M196 tracer
                    ammunition. The Air Force continued to operate these weapons until around 2001, at which time the
                    Air Force converted all of its M16s to the M16A2 configuration.

                    The M16 was also adopted by the British SAS, who used it during the Falklands War</p>
                <br>
                <h3>XM16E1 and M16A1 (Colt Model 603)</h3><br>
                <p>The U.S. Army XM16E1 was essentially the same weapon as the M16 with the addition of a forward assist
                    and corresponding notches in the bolt carrier. The M16A1 was the finalized production model in 1967
                    and was produced until 1982.
                    To address issues raised by the XM16E1's testing cycle, a closed, birdcage symmetric flash
                    suppressor with open side slots to the top, bottom, left and right replaced the XM16E1's
                    three-pronged flash suppressor which caught on twigs and leaves from 1967 onwards. Various other
                    changes were made after numerous problems in the field. Cleaning kits were developed and issued
                    while barrels with chrome-plated chambers and later fully lined bores were introduced. A small
                    storage compartment inside the stock was introduced. The buttstock storage compartment is often used
                    for storing a basic cleaning kit.
                    With these and other changes, the malfunction rate slowly declined and new soldiers were generally
                    unfamiliar with early problems. A rib was built into the side of the receiver on the XM16E1 to help
                    prevent accidentally pressing the magazine release button while closing the ejection port cover.
                    This rib was later extended on production M16A1s to help in preventing the magazine release from
                    inadvertently being pressed. The hole in the bolt that accepts the cam pin was crimped inward on one
                    side, in such a way that the cam pin may not be inserted with the bolt installed backwards, which
                    would cause failures to eject until corrected. The M16A1 saw limited use in training capacities
                    until the early 2000s, but is no longer in active service with the U.S., although is still standard
                    issue in many world armies.

                <h3>M16A3</h3><br>
                <p>The M16A3 is a modified version of the M16A2 adopted in small numbers by the U.S. Navy SEAL, Seabee,
                    and Security units. It features the M16A1 selective fire trigger group providing "safe",
                    "semi-automatic" and "fully automatic" modes. Otherwise it is externally similar to the M16A2.</p>
                <br>

                <h3>M16A4</h3><br>
                <p>The M16A4 is the fourth generation of the M16 series. The iron sight/carrying handle assembly on the
                    M16A2/M16A3 upper receiver, was replaced by a MIL-STD-1913 "Picatinny railed" flat-top upper
                    receiver for mounting aiming optics or a removable iron sight/carrying handle assembly. The M16A4
                    rear aperture sights integrated in the Picatinny rail mounted carry handle assembly are adjustable
                    from 300 m (328 yd) up to 600 m (656 yd), where the further similar M16A2 iron sights line can reach
                    up to 800 m (875 yd). The FN M16A4, using safe/semi/three-round burst selective fire, became
                    standard issue for the U.S. Marine Corps.
                    Military issue rifles were also equipped with a full length quad Knight's Armament Company M5 RAS
                    Picatinny railed hand guard (that holds zero on the top rail), allowing vertical grips, lasers,
                    tactical lights, and other accessories to be attached, coining the designation M16A4 MWS (or Modular
                    Weapon System) in U.S. Army field manuals.
                    In 2014, Marine units were provided with a limited number of adjustable stocks in place of the
                    traditional fixed stock for their M16A4s to issue to smaller Marines who would have trouble
                    comfortably reaching the trigger when wearing body armor. The adjustable stocks were added as a
                    standard authorized accessory, meaning units can use operations and maintenance funds to purchase
                    more if needed.
                    The Marine Corps had long maintained the full-length M16 as their standard infantry rifle, but in
                    October 2015 the switch to the M4 carbine was approved as the standard-issue weapon, giving Marine
                    infantry a smaller and more compact weapon. Enough M4s were already in the inventory to re-equip all
                    necessary units by September 2016, and M16A4s were moved to support[19][204] and non-infantry
                    Marines.</p><br>
