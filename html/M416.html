                <h2>HISTORY</h2>
                <p>The United States Army's Delta Force, at the request of R&D NCO Larry Vickers, collaborated with
                    Heckler & Koch to develop a new carbine in the 1990s for use in close quarters combat. At this
                    point, they were equipped with the Heckler & Koch MP5, whose 9mm bullet was considered too weak, and
                    the M4 Carbine, which was considered too large. During development, Heckler & Koch capitalised on
                    experience gained developing the Bundeswehr's Heckler & Koch G36 assault rifle, the U.S. Army's XM8
                    rifle project (cancelled in 2005) and the British Armed Forces SA80 A2 upgrade programme. The
                    project was originally called the Heckler & Koch M4, but this was changed in response to a trademark
                    infringement suit filed by Colt Defense.

                    Delta Force replaced its M4s with the HK416 in 2004, after tests revealed that the piston operating
                    system significantly reduces malfunctions while increasing the life of parts. The HK416 has been
                    tested by the United States military and is in use with some law enforcement agencies. It has been
                    adopted as the standard rifle of the Norwegian Armed Forces (2008) and the French Armed Forces
                    (2017) and is used by many special operations units worldwide.

                    A modified variant underwent testing by the United States Marine Corps as the M27 Infantry Automatic
                    Rifle (IAR). After the Marine Corps Operational Test & Evaluation Activity supervised a round of
                    testing at MCAGCC Twentynine Palms, Fort McCoy, and Camp Shelby (for dust, cold-weather, and
                    hot-weather conditions, respectively). As of March 2012, fielding of 452 IARs had been completed of
                    4,748 ordered. Five infantry battalions: 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion and 2nd
                    Battalion, 4th Marines, out of Camp Pendleton; 1st Battalion, 3rd Marines, out of Marine Corps Base
                    Hawaii; 1st Battalion, 9th Marines, out of Camp Lejeune; and 1st Battalion, 25th Marines, out of
                    Fort Devens deployed the weapon. In December 2017, the Marine Corps revealed a decision to equip
                    every Marine in an infantry squad with the M27.</p>

                <br><br>

                <h2>DESIGN</h2>
                <P>The HK416 uses a HK-proprietary short-stroke gas piston system that derives from the HK G36, forgoing
                    the direct gas-impingement system action that is standard in AR-15 rifles. The HK G36 gas system was
                    in turn partially derived from the AR-18 assault rifle designed in 1963. The HK system uses a
                    short-stroke piston driving an operating rod to force the bolt carrier to the rear. This design
                    prevents combustion gases from entering the weapon's interior—a shortcoming with direct impingement
                    systems. The reduction in heat and fouling of the bolt carrier group increases the reliability of
                    the weapon and extends the interval between stoppages. During factory tests the HK416 fired 10,000
                    rounds in full-auto without malfunctioning. The HK416's piston system was originally self-regulating
                    in theory, but in the default position tends to give increased recoil over an adjustable gas system.
                    A user adjustable gas regulator was added in later variants.

                    The HK416 is equipped with a proprietary accessory rail forearm with MIL-STD-1913 rails on all four
                    sides. This lets most current accessories for M4/M16-type weapons fit the HK416. The HK416 rail
                    forearm can be installed and removed without tools by using the bolt locking lug as the screwdriver.
                    The rail forearm is "free-floating" and does not contact the barrel, improving accuracy.

                    The HK416 has an adjustable multi-position telescopic butt stock, offering six different lengths of
                    pull. The shoulder pad can be either convex or concave and the stock features a storage space for
                    maintenance accessories, spare electrical batteries or other small kit items. It can also be
                    switched out for other variations like Magpul stocks.

                    The trigger pull is 34 N (7.6 lbf). The empty weight of a HK416 box magazine is 250 g (8.8 oz).

                    The HK416's barrel is cold hammer-forged with a 20,000-round service life and features a 6 grooves
                    178 mm (7 in) right hand twist. The cold hammer-forging process provides a stronger barrel for
                    greater safety in case of an obstructed bore or for extended firing sessions. Modifications for an
                    over-the-beach (OTB) capability such as drainage holes in the bolt carrier and buffer system are
                    available to let the HK416 fire safely as quickly as possible after being submerged in liquids like
                    water. To reduce the risk of slam-firing, the HK416 features a proprietary firing pin safety in the
                    bolt. This firing pin safety limits the HK416 upper to working with standard AR-15 type full height
                    hammers in the fire control group of the lower.</P>

                <h2>VARIANTS</h2>
                <br>
                <h3>HK416</h3><br>
                <p>The HK416 chambered for 5.56×45mm NATO is offered in multiple barrel lengths available to the
                    military and law enforcement market only.</p>

                <ul type="square" class="ri">
                    <li> D10RS: sub-compact with a 264 mm (10.4 in) barrel</li>
                    <li> D14.5RS (D145RS): carbine 368 mm (14.5 in) barrel</li>
                    <li> D16.5RS (D165RS): rifle with 419 mm (16.5 in) barrel</li>
                    <li> D20RS: full-sized rifle 508 mm (20 in) barrel</li>
                </ul>
                <p> The HK416C "C" for Compact is an ultra-compact version that only remained as a prototype and never
                    went to full production. It has a 228 mm (9.0 in) barrel and is expected to produce muzzle
                    velocities of approximately 730 m/s (2,395 ft/s). It was submitted for the Ultra Compact Individual
                    Weapon contract but lost to the LWRC M6A2.

                    The M27 Infantry Automatic Rifle is a squad automatic weapon variant developed from the D16.5RS,
                    adopted in 2011 by the United States Marine Corps. In 2018 the USMC decided to adopt the M27 IAR as
                    their infantry standard service rifle.</p>

                <br>
                <h3>HK416 A5</h3> <br>
                <p>The HK416 A5 is an improved variant that was first seen in the Individual Carbine competition. It
                    features a stock similar to that of the G28 designated marksman rifle, except slimmer and
                    non-adjustable. The rifle features an improved tool-less adjustable gas regulator for suppressor
                    use, which can accommodate barrel lengths down to 267 mm (10.5 in) without modifications. It also
                    features a redesigned lower receiver with ambidextrous fire controls, optimised magazine and
                    ammunition compatibility, a repair kit housed inside the pistol grip, and a Flat Dark Earth color
                    scheme. The stock has a fixed buttplate and no longer has a storage space, as well as the sling
                    loops removed from it. The V2 HK Battle grip is incorporated, which has the V2 grip profile with the
                    storage compartment of the V1 grip for tools. The handguard uses a new hexagonal-shaped cross bolt
                    that cannot be removed by the bolt locking lugs but instead by the takedown tool housed inside the
                    grip. It has a "heavy duty castle nut", which is more robust than the previous version, therefore
                    making that weak spot more resistant to impact.

                    As of 2013, Heckler & Koch replaced the original HK416 with the A5 variant.</p><br>

                <ul type="square" class="ri">
                    <li>HK416 A5 – 11": sub-compact with a 279 mm (11.0 in) barrel</li>
                    <li>HK416 A5 – 14.5": carbine 368 mm (14.5 in) barrel</li>
                    <li>HK416 A5 – 16.5": rifle with 419 mm (16.5 in) barrel</li>
                    <li>HK416 A5 – 20": full-sized rifle 508 mm (20 in) barrel</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>HK416 A7</h3> <br>
                <p>The HK416 A7 is designed for the German KSK and KSM, (designated as G95). A new safety selector has
                    been installed, which rotates 45 degrees rather than 90 degrees as on the M16/M4/AR standard safety
                    selectors. The new configuration of the selector is comparable to those of aftermarket 45-degree
                    safety selectors. The HK416 A7 also features a KeyMod Rail System, which is more lightweight than
                    the traditional Picatinny Rail Systems.</p>
